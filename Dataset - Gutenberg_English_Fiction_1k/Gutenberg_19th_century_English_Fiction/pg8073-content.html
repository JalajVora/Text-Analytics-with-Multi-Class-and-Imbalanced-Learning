<p>It was a December morning, - the Missouri December of mild temperatures and saturated skies, - and the Chicago and Alton's fast train, dripping from the rush through the wet night, had steamed briskly to its terminal track in the Union Station at Kansas City.
<p>Two men, one smoking a short pipe and the other snapping the ash from a scented cigarette, stood aloof from the hurrying throngs on the platform, looking on with the measured interest of those who are in a melee but not of it.
<p>"More delay," said the cigarettist, glancing at his watch. "We are over an hour late now. Do we get any of it back on the run to Denver?"
<p>The pipe-smoker shook his head.
<p>"Hardly, I should say. The Limited is a pretty heavy train to pick up lost time. But it won't make any particular difference. The western connections all wait for the Limited, and we shall reach the seat of war to-morrow night, according to the Boston itinerary."
<p>Mr. Morton P. Adams flung away the unburned half of his cigarette and masked a yawn behind his hand.
<p>"It's no end of a bore, Winton, and that is the plain, unlacquered fact," he protested. "I think the governor owes me something. I worried through the Tech because he insisted that I should have a profession; and now I am going in for field work with you in a howling winter wilderness because he insists on a practical demonstration. I shall ossify out there in those mountains. It's written in the book."
<p>"Humph! it's too bad about you," said the other ironically. He was a fit figure of a man, clean-cut and vigorous, from the steadfast outlook of the gray eyes and the firm, smooth-shaven jaw to the square fingertips of the strong hands, and his smile was of good-natured contempt. "As you say, it is an outrage on filial complaisance. All the same, with the right-of-way fight in prospect, Quartz Creek Canyon may not prove to be such a valley of dry bones as - Look out, there!"
<p>The shifting-engine had cut a car from the rear of the lately-arrived Alton, and was sending it down the outbound track to a coupling with the Transcontinental Limited. Adams stepped back and let it miss him by a hand's-breadth, and as the car was passing, Winton read the name on the paneling.
<p>"The Rosemary: somebody's twenty-ton private outfit. That cooks our last chance of making up any lost time between this and tomorrow - "
<p>He broke off abruptly. On the square rear observation platform of the private car were three ladies. One of them was small and blue-eyed, with wavy little puffs of snowy hair peeping out under her dainty widow's cap. Another was small and blue-eyed, with wavy masses of flaxen hair caught up from a face which might have served as a model for the most exquisite bisque figure that ever came out of France. But Winton saw only the third.
<p>She was taller than either of her companions - tall and straight and lithe; a charming embodiment of health and strength and beauty: clear-skinned, brown-eyed - a very goddess fresh from the bath, in Winton's instant summing up of her, and her crown of red-gold hair helped out the simile.
<p>Now, thus far in his thirty-year pilgrimage John Winton, man and boy, had lived the intense life of a working hermit, so far as the social gods and goddesses were concerned. Yet he had a pang - of disappointment or pointless jealousy, or something akin to both - when Adams lifted his hat to this particular goddess, was rewarded by a little cry of recognition, and stepped up to the platform to be presented to the elder and younger Bisques.
<p>So, as we say, Winton turned and walked away as one left out, feeling one moment as though he had been defrauded of a natural right, and deriding himself the next, as a sensible man should. After a bit he was able to laugh at the "sudden attack," as he phrased it, but later, when he and Adams were settled for the day-long run in the Denver sleeper, and the Limited was clanking out over the switches, he brought the talk around with a carefully assumed air of lack-interest to the party in the private car.
<p>"She is a friend of yours, then?" he said, when Adams had taken the baited hook open-eyed.
<p>The Technologian modified the assumption.
<p>"Not quite in your sense of the word, I fancy. I met her a number of times at the houses of mutual friends in Boston. She was studying at the Conservatory."
<p>"But she isn't a Bostonian," said Winton confidently.
<p>"Miss Virginia? - hardly. She is a Carteret of the Carterets; Virginia-born-bred-and-named. Stunning girl, isn't she?"
<p>"No," said Winton shortly, resenting the slang for no reason that he could have set forth in words.
<p>Adams lighted another of the scented villainies, and his clean-shaven face wrinkled itself in a slow smile.
<p>"Which means that she has winged you at sight, I suppose, as she does most men." Then he added calmly, "It's no go."
<p>"What is 'no go'?"
<p>Adams laughed unfeelingly, and puffed away at his cigarette.
<p>"You remind me of the fable about the head-hiding ostrich. Didn't I see you staring at her as if you were about to have a fit? But it is just as I tell you: it's no go. She isn't the marrying kind. If you knew her, she'd be nice to you till she got a good chance to flay you alive - "
<p>"Break it off!" growled Winton.
<p>"Presently. As I was saying, she would miss the chance of marrying the best man in the world for the sake of taking a rise out of him. Moreover, she comes of old Cavalier stock with an English earldom at the back of it, and she is inordinately proud of the fact; while you - er - you've given me to understand that you are a man of the people, haven't you?"
<p>Winton nodded absently. It was one of his minor fads to ignore his lineage, which ran decently back to a Colonial governor on his father's side, and to assert that he did not know his grandfather's middle name - which was accounted for by the very simple fact that the elder Winton had no middle name.
<p>"Well, that settles it definitely," was the Bostonian's comment. "Miss Carteret is of the sang azur. The man who marries her will have to know his grandfather's middle name - and a good bit more besides."
<p>Winton's laugh was mockingly good-natured.
<p>"You have missed your calling by something more than a hair's-breadth, Morty. You should have been a novelist. Give you a spike and a cross-tie and you'd infer a whole railroad. But you pique my curiosity. Where are these American royalties of yours going in the Rosemary?"
<p>"To California. The car belongs to Mr. Somerville Darrah, who is vice-president and manager in fact of the Colorado and Grand River road: the 'Rajah,' they call him. He is a relative of the Carterets, and the party is on its way to spend the winter on the Pacific coast."
<p>"And the little lady in the widow's cap: is she Miss Carteret's mother?"
<p>"Miss Bessie Carteret's mother and Miss Virginia's aunt. She is the chaperon of the party."
<p>Winton was silent while the Limited was roaring through a village on the Kansas side of the river. When he spoke again it was not of the Carterets; it was of the Carterets' kinsman and host.
<p>"I have heard somewhat of the Rajah," he said half-musingly. "In fact, I know him, by sight. He is what the magazinists are fond of calling an 'industry colonel,' a born leader who has fought his way to the front. If the Quartz Creek row is anything more than a stiff bluff on the part of the C. G. R. it will be quite as well for us if Mr. Somerville Darrah is safely at the other side of the continent - and well out of ordinary reach of the wires."
<p>Adams came to attention with a half-hearted attempt to galvanize an interest in the business affair.
<p>"Tell me more about this mysterious jangle we are heading for," he rejoined. "Have I enlisted for a soldier when I thought I was only going into peaceful exile as assistant engineer of construction on the Utah Short Line?"
<p>"That remains to be seen." Winton took a leaf from his pocket memorandum and drew a rough outline map. "Here is Denver, and here is Carbonate," he explained. "At present the Utah is running into Carbonate this way over the rails of the C. G. R. on a joint track agreement which either line may terminate by giving six months' notice of its intention to the other. Got that?"
<p>"To have and to hold," said Adams. "Go on."
<p>"Well, on the first day of September the C. G. R. people gave the Utah management notice to quit."
<p>"They are bloated monopolists," said Adams sententiously. "Still I don't see why there should be any scrapping over the line in Quartz Creek Canyon."
<p>"No? You are not up in monopolistic methods. In six months from September first the Utah people will be shut out of Carbonate business, which is all that keeps that part of their line alive. If they want a share of that traffic after March first, they will have to have a road of their own to carry it over."
<p>"Precisely," said Adams, stifling a yawn. "They are building one, aren't they?"
<p>"Trying to," Winton amended. "But, unfortunately, the only practicable route through the mountains is up Quartz Creek Canyon, and the canyon is already occupied by a branch line of the Colorado and Grand River."
<p>"Still I don't see why there should be any scrap."
<p>"Don't you? If the Rajah's road can keep the new line out of Carbonate till the six months have expired, it will have a monopoly of all the carrying trade of the camp. By consequence it can force every shipper in the district to make iron-clad contracts, so that when the Utah line is finally completed it won't be able to secure any freight for a year, at least."
<p>"Oho! that's the game, is it? I begin to savvy the burro: that's the proper phrase, isn't it? And what are our chances?"
<p>"We have about one in a hundred, as near as I could make out from Mr. Callowell's statement of the case. The C. G. R. people are moving heaven and earth to obstruct us in the canyon. If they can delay the work a little longer, the weather will do the rest. With the first heavy snow in the mountains, which usually comes long before this, the Utah will have to put up its tools and wait till next summer."
<p>Adams lighted another cigarette.
<p>"Pardon me if I seem inquisitive," he said, "but for the life of me I can't understand what these obstructionists can do. Of course, they can't use force."
<p>Winton's smile was grim. "Can't they? Wait till you get on the ground. But the first move was peaceable enough. They got an injunction from the courts restraining the new line from encroaching on their right of way."
<p>"Which was a thing that nobody wanted to do," said Adams, between inhalations.
<p>"Which was a thing the Utah had to do," corrected Winton. "The canyon is a narrow gorge - a mere slit in parts of it. That is where they have us."
<p>"Oh, well," returned Adams, "I suppose we took an appeal and asked to have the injunction set aside?"
<p>"We did, promptly; and that is the present status of the fight. The appeal decision has not yet been handed down; and in the meantime we go on building railroad, incurring all the penalties for contempt of court with every shovelful of earth moved. Do you still think you will be in danger of ossifying?"
<p>Adams let the question rest while he asked one of his own.
<p>"How do you come to be mixed up in it, Jack? A week ago some one told me you were going to South America to build a railroad in the Andes. What switched you?"
<p>Winton shook his head. "Fate, I guess; that and a wire from President Callowell of the Utah offering me this. Chief of Construction Evarts, in charge of the work in Quartz Creek Canyon, said what you said a few minutes ago - that he had not hired out for a soldier. He resigned, and I'm taking his berth."
<p>Adams rose and buttoned his coat.
<p>"By all of which it seems that we two are in for a good bit more than the ossifying exile," he remarked. And then: "I am going back into the Rosemary to pay my respects to Miss Virginia Carteret. Won't you come along?"
<p>"No," said Winton, more shortly than the invitation warranted; and the other went his way alone.
<p>"'Scuse me, sah; private cyah, sah."
<p>It was the porter's challenge in the vestibule of the Rosemary. Adams found a card.
<p>"Take that to Miss Carteret - Miss Virginia Carteret," he directed, and waited till the man came back with his welcome.
<p>The extension table in the open rear third of the private car was closed to its smallest dimensions, and the movable furnishings were disposed about the compartment to make it a comfortable lounging room.
<p>Mrs. Carteret was propped among the cushions of a divan with a book. Her daughter occupied the undivided half of a tete-a-tete chair with a blond athlete in a clerical coat and a reversed collar. Miss Virginia was sitting alone at a window, but she rose and came to greet the visitor.
<p>"How good of you to take pity on us!" she said, giving him her hand. Then she put him at one with the others: "Aunt Martha you have met; also Cousin Bessie. Let me present you to Mr. Calvert: Cousin Billy, this is Mr. Adams, who is responsible in a way for many of my Boston-learned gaucheries."
<p>Aunt Martha closed the book on her finger. "My dear Virginia!" she protested in mild deprecation; and Adams laughed and shook hands with the Reverend William Calvert and made Virginia's peace all in the same breath.
<p>"Don't apologize for Miss Virginia, Mrs. Carteret. We were very good friends in Boston, chiefly, I think, because I never objected when she wanted to - er - to take a rise out of me." Then to Virginia: "I hope I don't intrude?"
<p>"Not in the least. Didn't I just say you were good to come? Uncle Somerville tells us we are passing through the famous Golden Belt, - whatever that may be, - and recommends an easy-chair and a window. But I haven't seen anything but stubble-fields - dismally wet stubble-fields at that. Won't you sit down and help me watch them go by?"
<p>Adams placed a chair for her and found one for himself.
<p>"'Uncle Somerville' - am I to have the pleasure of meeting Mr. Somerville Darrah?"
<p>Miss Virginia's laugh was non-committal.
<p>"Quien sabe?" she queried, airing her one Westernism before she was fairly in the longitude of it. "Uncle Somerville is a law unto himself. He had a lot of telegrams and things at Kansas City, and he is locked in his den with Mr. Jastrow, dictating answers by the dozen, I suppose."
<p>"Oh, these industry colonels!" said Adams. "Don't their toilings make you ache in sheer sympathy sometimes?"
<p>"No, indeed," was the prompt rejoinder; "I envy them. It must be fine to have large things to do, and to be able to do them."
<p>"Degenerate scion of a noble race!" jested Adams. "What ancient Carteret of them all would have compromised with the necessities by becoming a captain of industry?"
<p>"It wasn't their metier, or the metier of their times," said Miss Virginia with conviction. "They were sword-soldiers merely because that was the only way a strong man could conquer in those days. Now it is different, and a strong man fights quite as nobly in another field - and deserves quite as much honor."
<p>"Think so? I don't agree with you - as to the fighting, I mean. I like to take things easy. A good club, a choice of decent theaters, the society of a few charming young women like - "
<p>She broke him with a mocking laugh.
<p>"You were born a good many centuries too late, Mr. Adams; you would have fitted so beautifully, into decadent Rome."
<p>"No - thanks. Twentieth-century America, with the commercial frenzy taken out of it, is good enough for me. I was telling Winton a little while ago - "
<p>"Your friend of the Kansas City station platform?" she interrupted. "Mightn't you introduce us a little less informally?"
<p>"Beg pardon, I'm sure - yours and Jack's: Mr. John Winton, of New York and the world at large, familiarly known to his intimates - and they are precious few - as 'Jack W.' As I was about to say - "
<p>But she seemed to find a malicious satisfaction in breaking in upon him.
<p>"'Mr. John Winton': it's a pretty name as names go, but it isn't as strong as he is. He is an 'industry colonel,' isn't he? He looks it."
<p>The Bostonian avenged himself at Winton's expense for the unwelcome interruption.
<p>"So much for your woman's intuition," he laughed. "Speaking of idlers, there is your man to the dotting of the 'i'; a dilettante raised to the nth power."
<p>Miss Carteret's short upper lip curled in undisguised scorn.
<p>"I like men who do things," she asserted with pointed emphasis; whereupon the talk drifted eastward to Boston, and Winton was ignored until Virginia, having exhausted the reminiscent vein, said, "You are going on through to Denver?"
<p>"To Denver and beyond," was the reply. "Winton has a notion of hibernating in the mountains - fancy it; in the dead of winter! - and he has persuaded me to go along. He sketches a little, you know."
<p>"Oh, so he is an artist?" said Virginia, with interest newly aroused.
<p>"No," said Adams gloomily, "he isn't an artist - isn't much of anything, I'm sorry to say. Worse than all, he doesn't know his grandfather's middle name. Told me so himself."
<p>"That is inexcusable - in a dilettante," said Miss Virginia mockingly. "Don't you think so?"
<p>"It is inexcusable in anyone," said the Technologian, rising to take his leave. Then, as a parting word: "Does the Rosemary set its own table? or do you dine in the dining-car?"
<p>"In the dining-car, if we have one. Uncle Somerville lets us dodge the Rosemary's cook whenever we can," was the answer; and with this bit of information Adams went his way to the Denver sleeper.
<p>Finding Winton in his section, poring over a blue-print map and making notes thereon after the manner of a man hard at work, Adams turned back to the smoking-compartment.
<p>Now for Mr. Morton P. Adams the salt of life was a joke, harmless or otherwise, as the tree might fall. So, during the long afternoon which he wore out in solitude, there grew up in him a keen desire to see what would befall if these two whom he had so grotesquely misrepresented each to the other should come together in the pathway of acquaintanceship.
<p>But how to bring them together was a problem which refused to be solved until chance pointed the way. Since the Limited had lost another hour during the day there was a rush for the dining-car as soon as the announcement of its taking-on had gone through the train. Adams and Winton were of this rush, and so were the members of Mr. Somerville Darrah's party. In the seating the party was separated, as room at the crowded tables could be found; and Miss Virginia's fate gave her the unoccupied seat at one of the duet tables, opposite a young man with steadfast gray eyes and a firm jaw.
<p>Winton was equal to the emergency, or thought he was. Adams was still within call and he beckoned him, meaning to propose an exchange of seats. But the Bostonian misunderstood wilfully.
<p>"Most happy, I'm sure," he said, coming instantly to the rescue. "Miss Carteret, my friend signals his dilemma. May I present him?"
<p>Virginia smiled and gave the required permission in a word. But for Winton self-possession fled shrieking.
<p>"Ah - er - I hope you know Mr. Adams well enough to make allowances for his - for his - " He broke down helplessly and she had to come to his assistance.
<p>"For his imagination?" she suggested. "I do, indeed; we are quite old friends."
<p>Here was "well enough," but Winton was a man and could not let it alone.
<p>"I should be very sorry to have you think for a moment that I would - er - so far forget myself," he went on fatuously. "What I had in mind was an exchange of seats with him. I thought it would be pleasanter for you; that is, I mean, pleasanter for - " He stopped short, seeing nothing but a more hopeless involvement ahead; also because he saw signals of distress or of mirth flying in the brown eyes.
<p>"Oh, please!" she protested in mock humility. "Do leave my vanity just the tiniest little cranny to creep out of, Mr. Winton. I'll promise to be good and not bore you too desperately."
<p>At this, as you would imagine, the pit of utter self-abasement yawned for Winton, and he plunged headlong, holding the bill of fare wrong side up when the waiter asked for his dinner order, and otherwise demeaning himself like a man taken at a hopeless disadvantage. She took pity on him.
<p>"But let's ignore Mr. Adams," she went on sweetly. "I am much more interested in this," touching the bill of fare. "Will you order for me, please? I like - "
<p>When she had finished the list of her likings, Winton was able to smile at his lapse into the primitive, and gave the dinner order for two with a fair degree of coherence. After that they got on better. Winton knew Boston, and, next to the weather, Boston was the safest and most fruitful of the commonplaces. Nevertheless, it was not immortal; and Winton was just beginning to cast about for some other safe riding road for the shallop of small talk when Miss Carteret sent it adrift with malice aforethought.
<p>It was somewhere between the entrees and the fruit, and the point of departure was Boston art.
<p>"Speaking of art, Mr. Winton, will you tell me how you came to think of sketching in the mountains of Colorado at this time of year? I should think the cold would be positively prohibitive of anything like that."
<p>Winton stared - open-mouthed, it is to be feared.
<p>"I - I beg your pardon," he stammered, with the inflection which takes its pitch from blank bewilderment.
<p>Miss Virginia was happy. Dilettante he might be, and an unhumbled man of the world as well; but, to use the Reverend Billy's phrase, she could make him "sit up."
<p>"I beg yours, I'm sure," she said demurely. "I didn't know it was a craft secret."
<p>Winton looked across the aisle to the table where the Technologian was sitting opposite a square-shouldered, ruddy-faced gentleman with fiery eyes and fierce white mustaches, and shook a figurative fist.
<p>"I'd like to know what Adams has been telling you," he said. "Sketching in the mountains in midwinter! that would be decidedly original, to say the least of it. And I think I have never done an original thing in all my life."
<p>For a single instant the brown eyes looked their pity for him; generic pity it was, of the kind that mounting souls bestow upon the stagnant. But the subconscious lover in Winton made it personal to him, and it was the lover who spoke when he went on.
<p>"That is a damaging admission, is it not? I am sorry to have to make it - to have to confirm your poor opinion of me."
<p>"Did I say anything like that?" she protested.
<p>"Not in words; but your eyes said it, and I know you have been thinking it all along. Don't ask me how I know it: I couldn't explain it if I should try. But you have been pitying me, in a way - you know you have."
<p>The brown eyes were downcast. Frank and free-hearted after her kind as she was, Virginia Carteret was finding it a new and singular experience to have a man tell her baldly at their first meeting that he had read her inmost thought of him. Yet she would not flinch or go back.
<p>"There is so much to be done in the world, and so few to do the work," she pleaded in extenuation.
<p>"And Adams has told you that I am not one of the few? It is true enough to hurt."
<p>She looked him fairly in the eyes. "What is lacking, Mr. Winton - the spur?"
<p>"Possibly," he rejoined. "There is no one near enough to care, or to say 'Well done!'"
<p>"How can you tell?" she questioned musingly. "It is not always permitted to us to hear the plaudits or the hisses - happily, I think. Yet there are always those standing by who are ready to cry 'Io triumphe!' and mean it, when one approves himself a good soldier."
<p>The coffee had been served, and Winton sat thoughtfully stirring the lump of sugar in his cup. Miss Carteret was not having a monopoly of the new experiences. For instance, it had never before happened to John Winton to have a woman, young, charming, and altogether lovable, read him a lesson out of the book of the overcomers.
<p>He smiled inwardly and wondered what she would say if she could know to what battlefield the drumming wheels of the Limited were speeding him. Would she be loyal to her mentorship and tell him he must win, at whatever the cost to Mr. Somerville Darrah and his business associates? Or would she, womanlike, be her uncle's partizan and write one John Winton down in her blackest book for daring to oppose the Rajah?
<p>He assured himself it would make no jot of difference if he knew. He had a thing to do, and he was purposed to do it strenuously, inflexibly. Yet in the inmost chamber of his heart, where the barbarian ego stands unabashed and isolate and recklessly contemptuous of the moralities minor and major, he saw the birth of an influence which inevitably must henceforth be desperately reckoned with.
<p>Given a name, this new-born life-factor was love; love barely awakened, and as yet no more than a masterful desire to stand well in the eyes of one woman. None the less, he saw the possibilities: that a time might come when this woman would have the power to intervene; would make him hold his hand in the business affair at the very moment, mayhap, when he should strike the hardest.
<p>It was a rather unnerving thought, and when he considered it he was glad that their ways, coinciding for the moment, would presently go apart, leaving him free to do battle as an honest soldier in any cause must.
<p>The Rosemary party was rising, and Winton rose, too, folding the seat for Miss Virginia and carefully reaching her wrap from the rack.
<p>"I am so glad to have met you," she said, giving him the tips of her fingers and going back to the conventionalities as if they had never been ignored.
<p>But the sincerity in Winton's reply transcended the conventional form of it.
<p>"Indeed, the pleasure has been wholly mine, I assure you. I hope the future will be kind to me and let me see more of you."
<p>"Who knows?" she rejoined, smiling at him level-eyed. "The world has been steadily growing smaller since Shakespeare called it 'narrow.'"
<p>He caught quickly at the straw of hope. "Then we need not say good-by?"
<p>"No; let it be auf Wiedersehen," she said; and he stood aside to allow her to join her party.
<p>Two hours later, when Adams was reading in his section and Winton was smoking his short pipe in the men's compartment and thinking things unspeakable with Virginia Carteret for a nucleus, there was a series of sharp whistle-shrieks, a sudden grinding of the brakes, and a jarring stop of the Limited - a stop not down on the time-card.
<p>Winton was among the first to reach the head of the long train. The halt was in a little depression of the bleak plain, and the train-men were in conference over a badly-derailed engine when Winton came up. A vast herd of cattle was lumbering away into the darkness, and a mangled carcass under the wheels of the locomotive sufficiently explained the accident.
<p>"Well, there's only the one thing to do," was the engineer's verdict. "That's for somebody to mog back to Arroyo to wire for the wreck-wagon."
<p>"Yes, by gum! and that means all night," growled the conductor.
<p>There was a stir in the gathering throng of half-alarmed and all-curious passengers, and a red-faced, white-mustached gentleman, whose soft southern accent was utterly at variance with his manner, hurled a question bolt-like at the conductor.
<p>"All night, you say, seh? Then we miss ouh Denver connections?"
<p>"You can bet to win on that," was the curt reply.
<p>"Damn!" said the ruddy-faced gentleman; and then in a lower tone: "I beg your pahdon, my deah Virginia; I was totally unaware of your presence."
<p>Winton threw off his overcoat.
<p>"If you will take a bit of help from an outsider, I think we needn't wait for the wrecking-car," he said to the dubious trainmen. "It's bad, but not so bad as it looks. What do you say?"
<p>Now, as everyone knows, it is not in the nature of operative railway men to brook interference even of the helpful sort. But they are as quick as other folk to recognize the man in essence, as well as to know the clan slogan when they hear it. Winton did not wait for objections, but took over the command as one in authority.
<p>"Think we can't do it? I'll show you. Up on the tank, one of you, and heave down the jacks and frogs. We'll have her on the steel again before you can say your prayers."
<p>At the hearty command, churlish reluctance vanished and everybody lent a willing hand. In two minutes the crew of the Limited knew it was working under a master. The frogs were adjusted under the derailed wheels, the jack-screws were braced to lift and push with the nicest accuracy, and all was ready for the attempt to back the engine in trial. But now the engineer shook his bead.
<p>"I ain't the artist to move her gently enough with all that string o' dinkeys behind her," he said unhopefully.
<p>"No?" said Winton. "Come up into the cab with and I'll show you how." And he climbed to the driver's footboard with the doubting engineer at his heels.
<p>The reversing-lever went over with a clash; the air whistled into the brakes; and Winton began to ease the throttle open. The steam sang into the cylinders, the huge machine trembling like a living thing under the hand of a master.
<p>Slowly and by almost imperceptible degrees the life of the pent-up boiler power crept into the pistons and out through the connecting rods to the wheels. With the first thrill of the gripping tires Winton leaned from the window to watch the derailed trucks climb by half-inches up the inclined planes of the frogs.
<p>At the critical instant, when the entire weight of the forward half of the engine was poising for the drop upon the rails, he gave the precise added impulse. The big ten-wheeler coughed hoarsely and spat fire; the driving-wheels made a quick half-turn backward; and a cheer from the onlookers marked the little triumph of mind over matter.
<p>Winton found Miss Carteret holding his overcoat when he swung down from the cab, and he fancied her enthusiasm was tempered with something remotely like embarrassment. But she suffered him to walk back to the private car beside her; and in this sudden retreat from the scene of action he missed hearing the comments of his fellow craftsmen.
<p>"You bet, he's no 'prentice," said the fireman.
<p>"Not much!" quoth the engineer. "He's an all-round artist, that's about what he is. Shouldn't wonder if he was the travelin' engineer for some road back in God's country."
<p>"Travelin' nothing!" said the conductor. "More likely he's a train-master, 'r p'raps a bigger boss than that. Call in the flag, Jim, and we'll be getting a move."
<p>Oddly enough, the comment on Winton did not pause with the encomiums of the train crew. When the Limited was once more rushing on its way through the night, and Virginia and her cousin were safe in the privacy of their state-room, Miss Carteret added her word.
<p>"Do you know, Bessie, I think it was Mr. Adams who scored this afternoon?" she said.
<p>"How so?" inquired la petite Bisque, who was too sleepy to be over-curious.
<p>"I think he 'took a rise' out of me, as he puts it. Mr. Winton is precisely all the kinds of man Mr. Adams said he wasn't."
<p>It was late breakfast time when the Transcontinental Limited swept around the great curve in the eastern fringe of Denver, paused for a registering moment at "yard limits," and went clattering in over the switches to come to rest at the end of its long westward run on the in-track at the Union Depot.
<p>Having wired ahead to have his mail meet him at the yard limits registering station, Winton was ready to make a dash for the telegraph office the moment the train stopped.
<p>"That is our wagon, over there on the narrow-gage," he said to Adams, pointing out the waiting mountain train. "Have the porter transfer our dunnage, and I'll be with you as soon as I can send a wire or two."
<p>On the way across the broad platform he saw the yard crew cutting out the Rosemary, and had a glimpse of Miss Virginia clinging to the hand-rail and enjoying enthusiastically, he fancied, her first view of the mighty hills to the westward.
<p>The temptation to let the telegraphing wait while he went to say good morning to her was strong, but he resisted it and hastened the more for the hesitant thought. Nevertheless, when he reached the telegraph office he found Mr. Somerville Darrah and his secretary there ahead of him, and he observed that the explosive gentleman who presided over the destinies of the Colorado and Grand River appeared to be in a more than usually volcanic frame of mind.
<p>Now Winton, though new to the business of building railroads for the Utah Short Line, was not new to Denver or Colorado. Hence when the Rajah, followed by his secretarial shadow, had left the office, Winton spoke to the operator as to a friend.
<p>"What is the matter with Mr. Darrah, Tom? He seems to be uncommonly vindictive this morning."
<p>The man of dots and dashes nodded.
<p>"He's always crankier this time than he was the other. He's a holy terror, the Rajah is. I wouldn't work on his road for a farm down East - not if my job took me within cussing distance of him. Bet a hen worth fifty dollars he is up in Mr. Colbert's office right now, raising particular sand because his special engine wasn't standing here ready to snatch his private car on the fly, so's to go on without losing headway."
<p>Winton frowned thoughtfully, and he let his writing hand pause while he said, "So he travels special from Denver, does he?"
<p>"On his own road? - well, I should smile. Nothing is too good for the Rajah; or too quick, when he happens to be in a hurry. I wonder he didn't have the T. C. pull him special from Kansas City."
<p>Winton handed in his batch of telegrams and went his way reflective.
<p>What was Mr. Somerville Darrah's particular rush? As set forth by Adams, the plans of the party in the Rosemary contemplated nothing more hasty than a leisurely trip to the Pacific coast - a pleasure jaunt with a winter sojourn in California to lengthen it. Why, then, this sudden change from Limited regular trains to unlimited specials? Was there fresh news from the seat of war in Quartz Creek Canyon? Winton thought not. In that case he would have had his budget as well; and so far as his own advices went, matters were still as they had been. A letter from the Utah attorneys in Carbonate assured him that the injunction appeal was not yet decided, and another from Chief of Construction Evarts concerned itself mainly with the major's desire to know when he was to be relieved.
<p>But if Winton could have been an eavesdropper behind the door of Superintendent Colbert's office on the second floor of the Union Depot, his doubts would have been resolved instantly.
<p>The telegraph operator's guess went straight to the mark. Mr. Darrah was "raising particular sand" because his wire order for a special engine had not been obeyed to the saving of the ultimate second of time. But between his objurgations on that score, he was rasping out questions designed to exhaust the chief clerk's store of information concerning the status of affairs at the seat of war.
<p>"Will you inform me, seh, why I wasn't wired that this beggahly appeal was going against us?" he demanded wrathfully. "What's that you say, seh? Don't tell me you couldn't know what the decision of the cou't was going to be before it was handed down: that's what you-all are heah for - to find out these things! And what is all this about Majah Eva'ts resigning, and the Utah's sending East for a professional right-of-way fighteh to take his place? Who is this new man? Don't know? Dammit, seh! it's your business to know! Now when do you faveh me with my engine?"
<p>Thus the Rajah; and the chief clerk, himself known from end to end of the Colorado and Grand River as a queller of men, could only point out of the window to where the Rosemary stood engined and equipped for the race, and say meekly: "I'm awfully sorry you've been delayed, Mr. Darrah; very sorry, indeed. But your car is ready now. Shall I go along to be on hand if you need me?"
<p>"No, seh!" stormed the irate master; and the chief clerk's face became instantly expressive of the keenest relief. "You stay right heah and see that the wires to Qua'tz Creek are kept open - wide open, seh. And when you get an ordeh from me - for an engine, a regiment of the National Gyua'd, or a train-load of white elephants - you fill it. Do you understand, seh?"
<p>Meantime, while this scene was getting itself enacted in the superintendent's office, a mild fire of consternation was alight in the gathering room of the Rosemary. As we have guessed, Winton's packet of mail was not the only one which was delivered by special arrangement that morning to the incoming Limited at the yard registering station. There had been another, addressed to Mr. Somerville Darrah; and when he had opened it there had been a volcanic explosion and a hurried dash for the telegraph office, as recorded.
<p>Sifted out by the Reverend Billy, and explained by him to Mrs. Carteret and Bessie, the firing spark of the explosion appeared to be some news of an untoward character from a place vaguely designated as "the front."
<p>"It seems that there is some sort of a right-of-way scrimmage going on up in the mountains between our road and the Utah Short Line," said the young man. "It was carried into the courts, and now it turns out that the decision has gone against us."
<p>"How perfectly horrid!" said Miss Bessie. "Now I suppose we shall have to stay here indefinitely while Uncle Somerville does things." And placid Mrs. Carteret added plaintively: "It's too bad! I think they might let him have one little vacation in peace."
<p>"Who talks of peace?" queried Virginia, driven in from her post of vantage on the observation platform by the smoke from the switching-engine. "Didn't I see Uncle Somerville charging across to the telegraph office with war written out large in every line of him?"
<p>"I am afraid you did," affirmed the Reverend Billy; and thereupon the explanation was rehearsed for Virginia's benefit.
<p>The brown eyes flashed militant sympathy.
<p>"Oh, I wish Uncle Somerville would go to 'the front,' wherever that is, and take us along!" she cried. "It would be ever so much better than California."
<p>The Reverend William laughed; and Aunt Martha put in her word of expostulation, as in duty bound.
<p>"Why, my dear Virginia - the idea! You don't know in the least what you are talking about. I have been reading in the papers about these right-of-way troubles, and they are perfectly terrible. One report said they were arming the laboring men, and another said the militia might have to be called out."
<p>"Well, what of it?" said Virginia, with all the hardihood of youth and unknowledge. "It's something like a burning building: one doesn't want to be hard-hearted and rejoice over other people's misfortunes; but then, if it has to burn, one would like to be there to see."
<p>Miss Bessie put a stray lock of the flaxen hair up under its proper comb.
<p>"I'm sure I prefer California and the orange-groves and peace," she asserted. "Don't you, Cousin Billy?"
<p>What Mr. Calvert would have replied is no matter for this history, since at this precise moment the Rajah came in, "coruscating," as Virginia put it, from his late encounter with the superintendent's chief clerk.
<p>"Give them the word to go, Jastrow, and let's get out of heah," he commanded. And when the secretary had vanished the Rajah made his explanations to all and sundry. "I've been obliged in a manneh to change ouh itinerary. Anotheh company is trying to fault us up in Qua'tz Creek Canyon, and I am in a meashuh compelled to be on the ground. We shall be delayed only a few days, I hope; at the worst only until the first snow-storm comes; and, in the meantime, Califo'nia won't run away."
<p>Virginia clapped her hands.
<p>"Then we are really to go to 'the front' and see a right-of-way fight? Oh, won't that be perfectly intoxicating!"
<p>The Rajah glared at her as if she had said something incendiary. The picturesque aspect of the struggle had evidently not appealed to him. But he smiled grimly when he said: "Now there spoke the blood of the fighting Carterets: hope you won't change your mind, my deah." And with that he dived into his working den, pushing the lately-returned secretary in ahead of him.
<p>Virginia linked arms with Bessie, the flaxen-haired, when the wheels began to turn.
<p>"We are off," she said. "Let's go out on the platform and see the last of Denver."
<p>It was while they were clinging to the hand-rail, and looking back upon the jumble of railway activities out of which they had just emerged that the Rosemary, gaining headway, overtook another moving train running smoothly on a track parallel to that upon which the private car was speeding. It was the narrow-gage mountain connection of the Utah line, and Winton and Adams were on the rear platform of the last car. So it chanced that the four of them were presently waving their adieus across the wind-blown interspace. In the midst of it, or rather at the moment when the Rosemary, gathering speed as the lighter of the two trains, forged ahead, the Rajah came out to light his cigar.
<p>He took in the little tableau of the rear platforms at a glance, and when the slower train was left behind asked a question of Virginia.
<p>"Ah - wasn't one of those two the young gentleman who called on you yestehday afternoon, my deah?"
<p>Virginia admitted it.
<p>"Could you faveh me with his name?"
<p>"He is Mr. Morton P. Adams, of Boston."
<p>"Ah-h! and his friend - the young gentleman who laid his hand to ouh plow and put the engine on the track last night?"
<p>"He is Mr. Winton - a - an artist, I believe; at least, that is what I gathered from what Mr. Adams said of him."
<p>Mr. Somerville Darrah laughed, a slow little laugh, deep in his chest.
<p>"Bless youh innocent soul - he a picchuh - painteh? Not in a thousand yeahs, my deah Virginia. He is a railroad man, and a right good one at that. Faveh me with the name again; Winteh, did you say?"
<p>"No; Winton - Mr. John Winton."
<p>"D-d-devil!" gritted the Rajah, smiting the hand-rail with his clenched fist. "Hah! I beg your pahdon, my deahs - a meah slip of the tongue." And then, to the full as savagely: "By Heaven, I hope that train will fly the track and ditch him before eveh he comes within ordering distance of the work in Qua'tz Creek Canyon!"
<p>"Why, Uncle Somerville - how vindictive!" cried Virginia. "Who is he, and what has he done?"
<p>"He is Misteh John Winton, as you informed me just now; one of the brainiest constructing engineers in this entiah country, and the hardest man in this or any otheh country to down in a right-of-way fight - that's who he is. And it's not what he's done, my deah Virginia, it's what he is going to do. If I can't get him killed up out of ouh way," - but here Mr. Darrah saw the growing terror in two pairs of eyes, and realizing that he was committing himself before an unsympathetic audience, beat a hasty retreat to his stronghold at the other end of the Rosemary.
<p>"Well!" said the flaxen-haired Bessie, catching her breath. But Virginia laughed.
<p>"I'm glad I'm not Mr. Winton," she said.
<p>Morning in the highest highlands of the Rockies, a morning clear, cold, and tense, with a bell-like quality in the frosty air to make the cracking of a snow-laden spruce-bough resound like a pistol-shot. For Denver and the dwellers on the eastern plain the sun is an hour high; but the hamlet mining-camp of Argentine, with its dovecote railway station and two-pronged siding, still lies in the steel-blue depths of the canyon shadow.
<p>Massive mountains, dark green to the timber line and dazzling white above it, shut in the narrow valley to right and left. A mimic torrent, ice-bound in the quieter pools, drums and gurgles on its descent midway between two railway embankments, the one to which the station and side-tracks belong, old and well-settled, the other new and as yet unballasted. Just opposite the pygmy station a lateral gorge intersects the main canyon, making a deep gash in the opposing mountain bulwark, around which the new line has to find its way by a looping detour.
<p>In a scanty widening of the main canyon a few hundred yards below the station a graders' camp of rude slab shelters is turning out its horde of wild-looking Italians; and on a crooked spur track fronting the shanties blue wood-smoke is curling lazily upward from the kitchen car of a construction train.
<p>All night long the Rosemary, drawn by the sturdiest of mountain-climbing locomotives, had stormed onward and upward from the valley of the Grand, through black defiles and around the shrugged shoulders of the mighty peaks to find a resting-place in the white-robed dawn on the siding at Argentine. The lightest of sleepers, Virginia had awakened when the special was passing through Carbonate; and, drawing the berth curtain, she had lain for an hour watching the solemn procession of cliffs and peaks wheeling in stately and orderly array against the inky background of sky. Now, in the steel-blue dawn, she was - or thought she was - the first member of the party to dress and steal out upon the railed platform to look abroad upon the wondrous scene in the canyon.
<p>But her reverie, trance-like in its wordless enthusiasm, was presently broken by a voice behind her - the voice, namely, of Mr. Arthur Jastrow.
<p>"What a howling wilderness, to be sure, isn't it?" said the secretary, twirling his eyeglasses by the cord and looking, as he felt, interminably bored.
<p>"No, indeed; anything but that," she retorted warmly. "It is grander than anything I ever imagined. I wish there were a piano in the car. It makes me fairly ache to set it in some form of expression, and music is the only form I know."
<p>"I'm glad if it doesn't bore you," he rejoined, willing to agree with her for the sake of prolonging the interview. "But to me it is nothing more than a dreary wilderness, as I say; a barren, rock-ribbed gulch affording an indifferent right of way for two railroads."
<p>"For one," she corrected, in a quick upflash of loyalty for her kin.
<p>The secretary shifted his gaze from the mountains to the maiden and smiled. She was exceedingly good to look upon - high-bred, queenly, and just now the fine fire of enthusiasm quickened her pulses and sent the rare flush to neck and cheek.
<p>Jastrow the cold-eyed, the business automaton, set to go off with a click at Mr. Somerville Darrah's touch, had ambitions not automatic. Some day he meant to put the world of business under foot as a conqueror, standing triumphant on the apex of that pyramid of success which the Mr. Somerville Darrahs were so painstakingly uprearing. When that day should come, there would need to be an establishment, a menage, a queen for the kingdom of success. Summing her up for the hundredth time since the beginning of the westward flight, he thought Miss Carteret would fill the requirements passing well.
<p>But this was a divagation, and he pulled himself back to the askings of the moment, agreeing with her again without reference to his private convictions.
<p>"For one, I should have said," he amended. "We mean to have it that way, though an unprejudiced onlooker might be foolish enough to say that there is a pretty good present prospect of two."
<p>But Miss Carteret was in a contradictory mood. Moreover, she was a woman, and the way to a woman's confidence does not lie through the neutral country of easy compliance.
<p>"If you won't take the other side, I will," she said. "There will be two."
<p>Jastrow acquiesced a second time.
<p>"I shouldn't wonder. Our competitor's road seems to be only a question of time - a very short time, judging from the number of men turning out in the track gang down yonder."
<p>Virginia leaned over the railing to look past the car and the dovecote station shading her eyes to shut out the snow-blink from the sun-fired peaks.
<p>"Why, they are soldiers!" she exclaimed. "At least, some of them have guns on their shoulders. And see - they are forming in line!"
<p>The secretary adjusted his eye-glasses.
<p>"By Jove! you are right; they have armed the track force. The new chief of construction doesn't mean to take any chances of being shaken loose by main strength. Here they come."
