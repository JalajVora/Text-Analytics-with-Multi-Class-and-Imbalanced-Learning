## Problem: Genre Identification on (a sub-set of) Gutenberg Corpus
Consider this set of books belonging to the 19th Century English Fiction1. 
The data set is created from Project Gutenberg 2. The data set consists of about 1000 books and roughly
10 genres. The task here consists of detection (i.e. classification) of genre3 of a book. Each
data-point in this classification task is a fiction book with a label (genre). Please note the
following three main challenges tackled:
1. Extract features that are relevant to fiction books, which may include ideas like sentiment, setting4 and so on, using appropriate libraries if possible. 
1. Outline of all the models used and why and how model selection was performed.
1. Explaination of how the evaluation of the model is being done and how the data set is to be
partitioned while taking into account potential challenges like class imbalances and
similar.

We have one task as a nice-to-have feature (optional): Can we estimate the
bias and variance5 of at least one of our models and also visualize it?
