<p>As soon as the subtle siren was left alone in the drawing-room with the aged clergyman she began weaving her spells around him as successfully as did the beautiful enchantress Vivien around the sage Merlin.
<p>Throwing her bewildering dark eyes up to his face she murmured in hurried tones:
<p>"You will not betray me to this family? Oh, consider! I am so young and so helpless!"
<p>"And so beautiful," added the old man under his breath, as he gazed with involuntary admiration upon her fair, false face. Then, aloud, he said: "I have already told you, wretched child, that I would forbear to expose you so long as you should conduct yourself with strict propriety here; but no longer."
<p>"You do not trust me. Ah, you do not see that one false step with its terrible consequences has been such an awful and enduring lesson to me that I could not make another! I am safer now from the possibility of error than is the most innocent and carefully guarded child. Oh, can you not understand this?" she asked, pathetically.
<p>And her argument was a very specious and plausible one, and it made an impression.
<p>"I can well believe that the fearful retribution that followed so fast upon your 'false step,' as you choose to call it, has been and will be an awful warning to you. But some warnings come too late. What can be your long future life?" he sadly inquired.
<p>"Alas, what?" she echoed, with a profound sigh. "Even under the most propitious circumstances - what? If I am permitted to stay here I shall be buried alive in this country house, without hope of resurrection. Perhaps fifty years I may have to live here. The old lady will die. Emma will marry. Her children will grow up and marry. And in all the changes of future years I shall vegetate here without change, and without hope except in the better world. And yet, dreary as the prospect is, it is the best that I can expect, the best that I can even desire, and much better than I deserve," she added, with a humility that touched the old man's heart.
<p>"I feel sorry for you, child; very, very sorry for your blighted young life. Poor child, you can never be happy again; but listen - you can be good!" he said, very gently.
<p>And then he suddenly remembered what her bewildering charms had made him for a moment forget - that was, that this unworthy girl had been actually on the point of marriage with an honorable man when Death stepped in and put an end to a foolish engagement.
<p>So, after a painful pause, he said, slowly:
<p>"My child, I have heard that you were about to be married to Charles Cavendish, when his sudden death arrested the nuptials. Is that true?"
<p>"It is true," she answered, in a tone of humility and sorrow.
<p>"But how could you venture to dream of marrying him?"
<p>"Ah, me; I knew I was unworthy of him! But he fell in love with me. I could not help that. Now, could I? Now, could I?" she repeated, earnestly and pathetically, looking at him.
<p>"N-n-no. Perhaps you could not," he admitted.
<p>"And oh, he courted me so hard! - so hard! And I could not prevent him!"
<p>"Could you not have avoided him? Could you not have left the house?"
<p>"Ah, no; I had no place to go to! I had lost my situation in the school."
<p>"Still you should never have engaged yourself to marry Charles Cavendish, for you must have been aware that if he had known your true story he would never have thought of taking you as his wife."
<p>"Oh, I know it! And I knew it then. And I was unhappy enough about it. But oh, what could I do? I could not prevent his loving me, do what I would. I could not go away from the house, because I had no place on earth to go to. And least of all would I go to him and tell him the terrible story of my life. I would rather have died than have told that! I should have died of humiliation in the telling - I couldn't tell him! Now could I? Could I?"
<p>"I suppose you had not the courage to do so."
<p>"No, indeed I had not! Yet very often I told him, in a general way, that I was most unworthy of him. But he never would believe that."
<p>"No; I suppose he believed you to be everything that is pure, good and heavenly. What a terrible reproach his exalted opinion of you must have been!"
<p>"Oh, it was - it was!" she answered, hypocritically. "It was such a severe reproach that, having in a moment of weakness yielded to his earnest prayer and consented to become his wife, I soon cast about for some excuse for breaking the engagement; for I felt if it were a great wrong to make such an engagement it would be a still greater wrong to keep it. Don't you agree with me?"
<p>"Yes, most certainly."
<p>"Well, while I was seeking some excuse to break off the marriage Death stepped in and put an end to it. Perhaps then I ought to have left the house, but - I had no money to go with and, as I said before, no place to go to. And besides Emma Cavendish was overwhelmed with grief and could not bear to be left alone; and she begged me to come down here with her. So, driven by my own necessities and drawn by hers, I came down. Do you blame me? Do you blame me?" she coaxed, pathetically.
<p>"No, I do not blame you for that. But," said the old man, gravely and sadly, shaking his head, "why, when you got here, did you turn eavesdropper and spy?"
<p>"Oh, me! - oh, dear me!" sobbed the siren. "It was the sin of helplessness and cowardice. I dreaded discovery so much! Every circumstance alarmed me. Your arrival and your long mysterious conversation with madam alarmed me. I thought exposure imminent. I feared to lose this home, which, lonely, dreary, hopeless as it is to me, is yet the only refuge I have left on earth. I am penniless and helpless; and but for this kind family I should be homeless and friendless. Think if I had been cast out upon the world what must have been my fate!"
<p>"What, indeed!" echoed the old man.
<p>"Therefore, I dreaded to be cast out. I dreaded discovery. Your visit filled me with uneasiness, that, as the day wore away, reached intense anxiety, and finally arose to insupportable anguish and suspense. Then I went to listen at the door, only to hear whether your conversation concerned me - whether I was still to be left in peace or to be cast out upon the bitter cold world. Ah, do not blame me too much! Just think how I suffered!" she said, pathetically, clasping her hands.
<p>murmured the old man to himself. Then, aloud, he said:
<p>"Poor girl, you were snared in the web of your own contriving! Yet still, when I caught you in that net, why did you deny your identity and try to make me believe that you were somebody else?"
<p>"Oh, the same sin of helplessness and cowardice; the same fear of discovery and exposure; the same horror of being cast forth from this pure, safe, peaceful home into the bitter, cold, foul, perilous world outside! I feared, if you found out who I was, you would expose me, and I should be cast adrift. And then it all came so suddenly I had no time for reflection. The instinct of self-preservation made me deny my identity before I considered what a falsehood I uttered. Ah, have you no pity for me, in considering the straits to which I was reduced?" she pleaded, clasping her hands before him and raising her eyes to his face.
<p>"'The way of the transgressor is hard,'" murmured the minister to himself. Then he answered her:
<p>"Yes, I do pity you very much. I pity you for your sins and sufferings. But more than all I pity you for the moral and spiritual blindness of which you do not even seem to be suspicious, far less conscious."
<p>"I do not understand you," murmured Mary Grey, in a low, frightened tone.
<p>"No, you do not understand me. Well, I will try to explain. You have pleaded your youth as an excuse for your first 'false step,' as you call it. But I tell you that a girl who is old enough to sin is old enough to know better than to sin. And if you were not morally and spiritually blind you would see this. Secondly, you have pleaded your necessities - that is, your interests - as a just cause and excuse for your matrimonial engagement with Governor Cavendish, and for your eavesdropping in this house, and also for your false statements to me. But I tell you if you had been as truly penitent as you professed to be you would have felt no necessity so pressing as the necessity for true repentance, forgiveness and amendment. And if you had not been morally and spiritually blind you would have seen this also. I sometimes think that it may be my duty to discover you to this family. Yet I will be candid with you. I fear that if you should be turned adrift here you might, and probably would, fall into deeper sin. Therefore I will not expose you - for the present, and upon conditions. You are safe from me so long as you remain true, honest and faithful to this household. But upon the slightest indication of any sort of duplicity or double dealing I shall unmask you to Madam Cavendish. And now you had better retire. Good-night."
<p>And with these words the old man walked to a side-table, took a bed-room candle in his hand and gave it to the widow.
<p>Mary Grey snatched and kissed his hand, courtesied and withdrew.
<p>When she got to her own room she threw herself into a chair and laughed softly, murmuring:
<p>"The old Pharisee! He is more than half in love with me now. I know it, and I feel it. Yet, to save his own credit with himself, he pretends to lecture me and tries to persuade himself that he means it. But he is half in love with me. Before I have done with him he shall be wholly in love with me. And won't it be fun to have his gray head at my feet, proposing marriage to me! And that is what I mean to bring him to before a month is over his venerable skeleton!"
<p>And, with this characteristic resolution, Mary Grey went to bed.
<p>There never was a closer friendship between two girls than that which bound Laura Lytton and Emma Cavendish together.
<p>On the night of Laura's arrival, after they had retired from the drawing-room, and Electra had gone to bed and gone to sleep, Laura and Emma sat up together in Emma's room and talked until nearly daylight - talked of everything in the heavens above, the earth below, and the waters under the earth. And then, when at length they parted, Laura asked:
<p>"May I come in here with you to dress to-morrow? And then we can finish our talk."
<p>"Surely, love! Use my room just like your own," answered Emma, with a kiss.
<p>And they separated for a few hours.
<p>But early in the morning, as soon as Emma was out of bed, she heard a tap at her chamber door, and she opened it to see Laura standing there in her white merino dressing-gown, with her dark hair hanging down and a pile of clothing over her arms.
<p>"Come in, dear," said Emma, greeting her with a kiss.
<p>And Laura entered and laid her pile of clothing on a chair, discovering in her hand a rich casket, which she set upon the dressing-table, saying:
<p>"Here, Emma, dear, I have something very curious to show you. You have heard me speak of some unknown friend who is paying the cost of my brother's and my own education?"
<p>"Yes. Haven't you found out yet who he is?" inquired Miss Cavendish.
<p>"No; and I do not even know whether our benefactor is a he or a she. But anyhow he has sent me this," said Laura, unlocking the casket and lifting the lid.
<p>"A set of diamonds and opals fit for a princess!" exclaimed Emma, in admiration, as she gazed upon the deep blue satin tray, on which was arranged a brooch, a pair of ear-rings, a bracelet and a necklace of the most beautiful opals set in diamonds.
<p>"Yes, they are lovely! They must have come from Paris. They are highly artistic," answered Laura. "But look at these others, will you? These are barbaric," she added, lifting the upper tray from the casket and taking from the recess beneath the heaviest cable gold chain, a heavier finger ring, and a pair of bracelets. "Just take these in your double hands and 'heft' them, as the children say," she concluded, as she put the weight of gold in Emma's open palms, which sank at first under the burden.
<p>"There; what do you think of that?" inquired Laura.
<p>"I think they are barbaric, as you said. Well intended, no doubt, but utterly barbaric. Why, this gold chain might fasten up the strongest bull-dog and these bracelets serve as fetters for the most desperate felon! Where on earth were they manufactured?" inquired Miss Cavendish.
<p>"In some rude country where there was more gold than good taste, evidently. However, Emma, dear, there is something very touching, very pathetic, to my mind, in these anonymous offerings. Of course they are almost useless to me. I could never wear the chain or the bracelets. They are far too clumsy for any one but an Indian chief; and I can never wear those lovely opals unless by some miracle I grow rich enough to have everything in harmony with them. And yet, Emma, the kindness and - what shall I say? - the humility of this anonymous giver so deeply touches my heart that I would not part with even a link of this useless chain to buy myself bread if I were starving," murmured Laura, with the tears filling her eyes, as she replaced the jewels in their casket.
<p>"And you have no suspicion who the donor is?"
<p>"None whatever. These came to me through Mr. Lyle, the agent who receives and pays the money for our education."
<p>"What does your brother say to all this?"
<p>"Oh, it makes him very uneasy at times. He shrinks from receiving this anonymous assistance. It is all Mr. Lyle can do now, by assuring him that in the end he will find it all right, to induce him to continue to receive it. And, at all events, he declares that after he graduates he will not take another dollar of this anonymous fund - conscience money or not - but that he will begin to pay back in bank, with interest and compound interest, the debt that he is now incurring."
<p>"I think that resolution is highly to his honor," said Emma Cavendish.
<p>"And he will keep it. I know Alden," answered Laura.
<p>And then the two girls hastened to dress themselves for breakfast. And very well they both looked as they left their room.
<p>Laura wore her crimson merino morning-dress, with white linen cuffs and collar, a costume that well became her olive complexion and dark hair and eyes.
<p>Emma wore a black cashmere trimmed with lusterless black silk, and folded book-muslin cuffs and collar. And in this dark dress her radiant blonde beauty shone like a fair star.
<p>They rapped at Electra's door to bring her out.
<p>She made her appearance looking quite dazzling. Electra had a gay taste in dress. She loved bright colors and many of them. She wore a purple dressing-gown with a brilliant shawl border - a dress for a portly old lady rather than for a slim young girl.
<p>They went down together to the breakfast-room, where they found the languishing widow and the old clergyman tête-à-tête.
<p>Mrs. Grey greeted them with a sweet smile and honeyed words, and Dr. Jones with a kindly good-morning and handshake.
<p>And they sat down to breakfast.
<p>This Easter Sunday had dawned clearly and beautifully. The family of Blue Cliffs were all going to attend divine service at Wendover.
<p>So, as soon as breakfast was over, the carriage was ordered, and the young ladies went upstairs to dress for church.
<p>At nine o'clock the whole party set out. Emma Cavendish, Laura Lytton and Electra Coroni went in the old family coach, carefully driven by Jerome. Mrs. Grey went in a buggy driven by the Rev. Dr. Jones.
<p>Who arranged this last drive, this tête-à-tête, no one knew except the artful coquette and her venerable victim.
<p>They all reached the church in good time.
<p>The rector, the Rev. Dr. Goodwin, read the morning service, and the Rev. Dr. Jones preached the sermon.
<p>At the conclusion of the services, when the congregation were leaving, Mr. Craven Kyte came up to pay his respects to the ladies from Blue Cliffs.
<p>Miss Cavendish introduced him to Dr. Jones, explaining that he had been a ward of her father, and was once an inmate of Blue Cliff Hall.
<p>Dr. Jones received the young man with courtesy, and in his turn introduced him to Miss Coroni.
<p>Then Emma Cavendish invited him to go home with them to dinner, kindly reminding him of the old custom of spending his holidays in his guardian's house.
<p>With a smile and a bow, and with a warm expression of thanks, the young man accepted the offered hospitality.
<p>And when the party entered their carriages to return to Blue Cliffs, Craven Kyte, mounted on a fine horse, attended them.
<p>But, mind, he did not ride beside the carriage that contained the three young ladies, but beside the gig occupied by Mary Grey and Dr. Jones.
<p>And the very first inquiry he made of Emma, on reaching the house, was:
<p>"Is the Reverend Doctor Jones a married man?"
<p>"Why, what a question!" exclaimed Emma, laughing. "No, he is not a married man; he is a widower. Why do you ask?"
<p>"I don't know. But I thought he was a widower. He seems very much taken with Mrs. Grey," sighed the young man.
<p>"Oh, is that it?" laughed Emma, as she ran away to take off her bonnet and mantle.
<p>And that Easter Sunday Mary Grey found herself again in a dilemma between her two proposed victims - the gray-haired clergyman and the raven-locked youth.
<p>But she managed them both with so much adroitness that at the close of the day, when Craven Kyte was riding slowly back to Wendover, he was saying to himself:
<p>"She is fond of me, after all; the beauty, the darling, the angel! Oh, that such a perfect creature should be fond of me! I am at this moment the very happiest man on earth!"
<p>And later the same night, when the Rev. Dr. Jones laid his woolen night-capped head upon his pillow, instead of going to sleep as the old gentleman should have done, he lay awake and communed with himself as follows:
<p>"Poor child - poor child! A mere baby. And she is penitent; sincerely penitent. Oh, I can see that! And to think that she is not nearly so much in fault as we believed her to be! She tells me that she really was married to that man - married when she was a child only fourteen years of age. So her gravest error was in running away to be married! And that was the fault of the man who stole her, rather than of herself. And she is as repentant for that fault as if it were some great crime. And oh, how she has suffered! What she has gone through for one so young! And she has such a tender, affectionate, clinging nature! Ah, what will become of her, poor child - poor child! She ought to have some one to take care of her. She ought indeed to be married, for no one but a tender husband could take care of such a pretty, delicate, helpless creature. She ought to marry some one much older than herself. Not a green, beardless boy like that young puppy - Heaven forgive me! - I mean that young man Kyte. He couldn't appreciate her, couldn't be a guide or a guard to her. And she really needs guiding and guarding too. For see how easily she falls into error. She ought to marry some good, wise, elderly man, who could be her guide, philosopher and friend as well as husband."
<p>And so murmuring to himself he fell asleep to dream that he himself was the model guide, philosopher and friend required by the young widow.
<p>The next day, Easter Monday, brought a messenger from Lytton Lodge; a messenger who was no other than Mithridates, commonly called "Taters," once a servant of Frederick Fanning, the landlord of White Perch Point, but now a hired hand of John Lytton's.
<p>Mithridates, or Taters, rode an infirm-looking old draft horse, with a dilapidated saddle and bridle, and wore a hat and coat exceedingly shabby for a gentleman's servant.
<p>He also led a second horse, furnished with a side-saddle.
<p>He dismounted at the carriage-steps, tied the horses to a tree, and boldly went to the front door and knocked.
<p>Jerome opened it, and administered a sharp rebuke to the messenger for presuming to knock at the visitors' door instead of at the servants'.
<p>"If I'd a come to the servants' I'd rapped at the servants' door; but as I have comed to the white folks' I rap at dere door. Here; I've fotch a letter from Marse Jacky Lytton to his niece, Miss Lorrer," said Taters, pompously.
<p>"Give it to me then, and I'll take it in to her," said Jerome.
<p>"Set you up with it! I must 'liver of this here letter with my own hands inter her own hands," said Taters, stoutly.
<p>"Well, come along, for a fool! You're a purty looking objick to denounce into the parlor, a'n't you now?" said Jerome, leading the way.
<p>At that moment, unseen by Jerome, but distinctly seen by Taters, a face appeared at the head of the stairs for an instant, but meeting the eye of Taters turned white as death and vanished.
<p>Taters uttered a terrible cry and sank, ashen pale and quaking with horror, at the foot of the steps.
<p>"Why, what in the name of the old boy is the matter with you, man? Have you trod on a nail or piece of glass, or anything that has gone through your foot, or what is it?" demanded Jerome, in astonishment.
<p>"Oh, no, no, no! it's worse'n that - it's worse'n that! It's no end worse'n that! Oh, Lor'! oh, Lor'! oh, Lor'!" cried Taters, holding his knees and sawing backward and forward in an agony of horror.
<p>"Ef you don't stop that howlin' and tell me what's the matter of you I'm blessed ef I don't get a bucket of ice water and heave it all over you to fetch you to your senses!" exclaimed the exasperated Jerome.
<p>"Oh, Lor', don't! Oh, please don't! I shill die quick enough now without that!" cried Taters, writhing horribly.
<p>"What's the matter, you born iddiwut?" roared Jerome, in a fury.
<p>"Oh, I've seen a sperrit - I've seen a sperrit! I've seen the sperrit of my young mistress! And it's a token of my death!" wailed the negro boy in agony.
<p>"What's that you say - a sperrit? A sperrit in this yer 'spectable, 'sponsible house? Lookee here, nigger: mind what you say now, or it'll be the wus for you! A sperrit in this yer ginteel family as never had a crime or a ghost inter it! The Cavendishers nebber 'mits no crimes when der living, nor likewise don't walk about ondecent after der dead. And der a'n't no sperrits here," said Jerome, with ire.
<p>"Oh, I wish it wasn't - I wish it wasn't! But it was a sperrit! And it's a token of my death - it's a token of my death!" howled Taters.
<p>And now at last the noise brought the three young ladies out of the drawing-room.
<p>"What is the matter here, Jerome?" inquired Mrs. Cavendish. "Has any one got hurt? Who is that man?"
<p>"Ef you please, Miss Emma, no one a'n't got hurt, though you might a thought, from the squalling, that there was a dozen pigs a killin'. And that man, miss, is a born iddiwut, so he is - begging your pardon, miss! - and says he's seed a sperrit in this yer harristocraterick house, where there never was a sperrit yet," explained Jerome, with a grieved and indignant look.
<p>"But who is the man? What is he doing here? And what does he want?" inquired the young lady.
<p>"The man is a born iddiwut, Miss Emma, as I telled you before; that's who the man he is! And he's a making of a 'fernal fool of hisself; that's what he's doing here! And he deserves a good hiding; and that's what he wants!" said Jerome, irately.
<p>Miss Cavendish passed by the privileged old family servant, and went up to the man himself and inquired:
<p>"Who are you, boy? What brings you here? And what ails you?"
<p>"Oh, miss! I'm Taters, I am. And I come to fetch a letter from Marse Jacky Lytton to Miss Lorrer. And I seen a sperrit at the top o'them stair steps. And that's what's the matter of me," cried the boy.
<p>"A spirit! Jerome, do you think he's been drinking?" inquired the young lady in a low, frightened voice.
<p>For an answer Jerome, without the least hesitation, seized Taters by the head, pulled open his jaws, and stuck his own nose into the cavity and took an audible snuff. Then, releasing the head, he answered:
<p>"No, miss, he a'n't been drinking nuffin. His breff's as sweet as a milch cow's. I reckon he must be subjick to epperliptic fits, miss, by the way he fell down here all of a suddint, crying out as he'd seen a sperrit."
<p>"You said you had a letter, boy. Where is it?" inquired Emma.
<p>"Here, miss! Here it is! I'll give it to you, though I wouldn't give it to him there!" answered Taters, with a contemptuous glance toward Jerome.
<p>Emma took the letter, which was inclosed in a wonderfully dingy yellow envelope, and she read the superscription, and then called to Laura, saying:
<p>"Come here, my dear. Here is a letter from Lytton Lodge for you."
<p>Laura Lytton, who, with Electra, had been standing just within the drawing-room door, near enough to observe the group, but not to hear the whole of their conversation, now came when she was called and received her letter.
<p>"It is from dear Uncle Jacky," she said, with an affectionate smile, as she recognized the handwriting.
<p>And then she asked the messenger a multitude of questions, which he was too much agitated to answer coherently, until at length Miss Cavendish said:
<p>"Jerome, take the poor fellow into the kitchen and give him something to eat and drink. There is nothing like beef and beer to exorcise evil spirits. And when he is rested and refreshed we will see him again."
<p>And Jerome took Taters rather roughly by the shoulder and pulled him upon his feet and carried him along the hall through the back door toward the kitchen.
<p>"Will you excuse me now, dear Emma, while I read my uncle's letter?" inquired Laura, as she retreated to the drawing-room.
<p>"Certainly," smiled Miss Cavendish, following her guests.
<p>Laura went into the recess of a bay-window and opened the dingy yellow envelope and read as follows:
<p>"Lytton Lodge, April  - , 18 - .
<p>"My dear Niece: - I think my nephew, Alden, has a more correcter ideer of what is jue to kin and kith than what you have shown.
<p>"Alden is spending his Easter holidays along of me and his relations.
<p>"But you haven't been nigh the house since you left it to go to school. You do seem to be so wrapped up in the Cavendishers as not to think anything of your own folks.
<p>"Now I can tell you what it is. The Lyttonses are a great deal older and better family than all the Cavendishers that ever lived. I don't care if they was governors of the state.
<p>"I have heard my grandfather, who was a scholar, say that the Lyttonses was landed gentry in the old country long before the Cavendishers followed of their lord and marster William the Conkerer across the channil. And so I don't approve of your sliting of the Lyttonses for them there Cavendishers. Spesherly as you're a Lytton yourself. And if we don't respect ourselves and each other no one a'n't a going to respect us.
<p>"And talking of that, what do you think Hezekiah Greenfield, the landlord of the Reindeer, went and done to me last week?
<p>"Why, he came over and asked me could I supply his tavern with fruits and vegetables during the summer season at the market price, saying - quite as if he was a making of me a kind proposal instead of offering of me a black insult - that he'd rather deal with me, and I should have his money, than any one else, if so be I was willing to do business.
<p>"Now what do you think I answered him?
<p>"Why, I set the bull-dog on him! I did that! And it was good for him as he scrambled up on his horse and made off double-quick, or he'd been torn to pieces before you could say Jack Robinson.
<p>"That'll learn the tavern-keeper to insult a gentleman next time by offering to buy his garden stuff!
<p>"But what I'm writing to you for, my dear, now, is this. I think you ought to come to see us, anyhow. You must come, if it's only for two or three days, to see your old grandmother, and all your relations, and to meet Alden, who is here, as I said. I have sent Taters on horseback with a led horse and a side-saddle for you. Come back along of him to-morrow morning. And give my honorable compliments to the old madam and Miss Cavendish. Because, mind you, I'm not a saying as the Cavendishers a'n't a good, respectabil family; only I do say as they are not so good as the Lyttonses, and they never was and never will be; and they know it themselves, too. Well, your dear grandma, and your dear aunties and cousins, all sends their love to you, with many good wishes. So no more at present from your affeckshunit uncle,
<p>"John Lytton."
<p>"Emma, dear, I have a letter from Uncle John Lytton," said Laura, gravely, going to the side of her friend.
<p>"I hope they are all well at Lytton Lodge," responded Emma.
<p>"Oh, yes, thank you, they are all quite well; but," added Laura, with a sigh, "Uncle John has written to me to come at once and pay them a visit. And to leave me no excuse, he has sent his servant Mithridates on horseback, with another led horse and side-saddle, to take me to Lytton Lodge."
<p>"Oh, dear! But you need not go, I hope?" said Emma, looking up, with a sigh.
<p>"I must go," answered Laura, with another sigh. "And really I ought to be glad to go to see such kind friends as all my relatives there have been to me. But, you see, Emma, I don't like to leave you for a single day even before I have to return to school."
<p>"Then why do you go at all? Why can you not send an excuse?"
<p>"Dear Emma, would you refuse to go if you were in my place?" inquired Laura.
<p>Emma Cavendish could not reply.
<p>"No, you would not," added Laura, "because it would not be right to refuse."
<p>"But, my dear, to perform so long a journey on horseback! It must be over twenty miles. Let me see - it is about nine miles from here to Wendover, and it must be ten or eleven from Wendover to Lytton Lodge," said Emma.
<p>"No; only about eight or nine. The whole distance is not more than seventeen or eighteen miles by the roundabout route. And if I could go as the crow flies it is not more than six miles. Why, you know the eastern extremity of your land touches the western extremity of uncle's."
<p>"So it does. And if, as you say, you could go as the crow flies - that is, straight over mountains and rivers - you could get there in two hours. As it is, it will take you five or six hours, and that is too long for a girl to be in the saddle, especially a city-bred girl, unaccustomed to such exercise."
<p>"I think I can stand it," smiled Laura.
<p>"But you shall not try. If you will go you must take the little carriage. When do you propose to start?"
<p>"To-morrow morning."
<p>"Well, we will send the redoubtable Mithridates back with his steeds, and send you on your journey in the little carriage, under the guardianship of old Jerome, with orders to remain with you during your visit; but to bring you back again, at farthest, on the third day," said Emma, peremptorily.
<p>Laura thanked her friend, but protested against any trouble being taken on her account.
<p>But Miss Cavendish was firm, and the arrangement was made according to her plan.
<p>In the meantime Mithridates, eating beef and bread and drinking home-made sweet cider in the kitchen, recovered some of his composure; though still, with his mouth full of meat and his eyes starting from his head, he persisted that he had seen the spirit of his young mistress. And it was a token of his death.
<p>"G'long way from her', boy! Ef I didn't know as you wasn't I should think as you was intoxified! There never was no sperrit never seen into this house," said Aunt Molly, indignantly.
<p>"I don't care! I did see her sperrit! So there now," persisted Taters, bolting a chunk of bread and choking with it for a moment. "And - and it's a token of my death."
<p>"Is that the reason you're a trying to kill yourself now, you iddiwut?"
<p>"No; but I seen her sperrit!"
<p>"I don't believe one word of it. You're a making of it all up out'n your own stoopid head! There, now, ef you're done eatin' you'd better go 'long and put up your hosses," said Aunt Moll, seeing her guest pause in his gastronomic efforts.
<p>But Taters hadn't done eating, and did't get done until all the dishes on the kitchen table were cleared and the jug of cider emptied.
<p>Then, indeed, he gave over and went to look after his "beasts."
<p>At the same hour Mary Grey, locked fast in her room, suffered agonies of terror and anxiety. She, too, had seen a "ghost" - a ghost of her past life - a ghost that might have come to summon her from her present luxurious home!
<p>On her way down-stairs to the drawing-room she had been arrested on the head of the middle landing by the sight of a once familiar face and form.
<p>She met the distended eyes of this apparition, and saw at once that he had recognized her as surely as she had recognized him.
<p>And in an instant she vanished.
<p>She darted into her own room and locked the door and sank breathless into the nearest chair.
<p>And there she sat now, with beating heart and burning head, waiting for what should come next.
<p>A rap at the door was the next thing that came.
<p>It frightened her, of course - everything frightened her now.
<p>"Who is that?" she nervously inquired.
<p>"Only me, ma'am. The ladies are waiting luncheon for you. Miss Emma sends her compliments and says will you come down?" spoke the voice of Sarah, the lady's maid.
<p>"Love to Miss Cavendish, and ask her to excuse me. I do not want any luncheon," answered Mary Grey, without opening the door.
<p>Then she sank back in her chair with throbbing pulses, waiting for the issue of this crisis. She was really ill with intense anxiety and dread. She grew so weak at last that she lay down upon her sofa.
<p>Then came another rap at the door.
<p>"Who is that?" she asked again, faintly.
<p>"It is I, dear," answered the voice of Emma Cavendish.
<p>Mrs. Grey arose trembling and opened the door.
<p>"I was afraid that you were not well. I came up to see," said Emma, kindly, as she entered the room.
<p>"I - no, I am not quite well," faltered Mary Grey, as she retreated to the sofa and sat down, with her back purposely to the light and her face in the shadow.
<p>"You really look pale and ill. What is the matter, dear?"
<p>"I - think I have taken cold. But by keeping to my room for a few days I hope to be better. A cold always affects the action of my heart and makes me very nervous," said Mary Grey, in explanation of the tremors for which she could not otherwise account.
<p>Then Emma expressed sympathy and sorrow, and begged the pretended invalid to have some tea and cream-toast, or some wine-whey or chicken-broth.
<p>But Mary Grey declined all these offers, declaring that a cold always took her appetite away.
<p>And again Emma expressed regret.
<p>And, as Miss Cavendish talked, Mary Grey grew more composed.
<p>It was evident, she thought, that Emma as yet knew nothing of that strange rencounter on the stairs.
<p>Presently, Miss Cavendish said:
<p>"I am sorry to tell you that we shall lose Laura Lytton for a few days. Her uncle, Mr. Lytton of Lytton Lodge, has sent a messenger for her. She goes to visit her relations there to-morrow morning."
<p>"Indeed - a messenger?" exclaimed Mary Grey, pricking up her ears.
<p>"Yes; a queer genius, who signalized his entrance into the house by a scene," added Emma, smiling.
<p>"Indeed!"
<p>"Oh, yes! Why, you might have heard the commotion in the front hall! Did you hear nothing of it?"
<p>"No, dear; I have remained shut up in my room ever since breakfast - have not stirred from it," answered Mary Grey, lying without the least hesitation.
<p>"That accounts for your knowing nothing about it. But the absurd fellow raised quite a confusion by suddenly falling down in the front hall in a spasm of terror, declaring that he had seen the spirit of his young mistress on the middle landing of the front stairs."
<p>"An optical illusion," answered Mary Grey, in a low, tremulous tone and with her face carefully kept in the shadow.
<p>"Of course! And it appears that he was once a servant of that reckless and unlucky Frederick Fanning of White Perch Point, who married my mother's sister. And consequently his young mistress must have been that unfortunate cousin of mine," said Emma, with a sigh.
<p>"Does any one know what ever became of that wretched girl?" inquired Mrs. Grey, in a very low tone.
<p>"No; but I gather from the wild talk of the boy that she is supposed to be dead. It was her spirit that he thinks he saw."
<p>"Whatever became of her father and mother?" questioned Mary Grey in the same low tone and still keeping her face in the deep shadow.
<p>"I do not know. I heard that they went to California. I have not heard anything of them since. But, my dear, you are talking beyond your strength. Your voice is quite faint - scarcely audible indeed. Now I advise you to lie down and be quiet," said Miss Cavendish, with some solicitude.
<p>And then she kissed Mary Grey, begged her to ring for anything she might require, and then she left the room.
<p>And Mary Grey heard no more of the ghost. That cloud passed harmlessly over her head.
<p>Early the next morning Miss Cavendish's snug little pony-carriage, with a pretty pair of grays, stood before the front door waiting for Laura Lytton.
<p>Old Jerome sat on the front seat to drive.
<p>Taters, with his own horse and the now useless led horse, was in attendance.
<p>Laura Lytton, dressed for her journey and with traveling-bag in hand, stood with Emma Cavendish in the hall waiting for Mrs. Gray, to whom they had sent a message inviting her to come down and see the traveler off.
<p>But presently the messenger returned with Miss Grey's love and good wishes, and requested that they would excuse her from coming down, as her cold was so severe that she did not dare to leave her room.
<p>"I must go up and bid her good-bye then," said Laura, as she dropped her traveling-bag and ran upstairs.
<p>She found Mary Grey in a fine white merino dressing-gown playing the interesting invalid.
<p>She hastily kissed her, expressed a hope that she might find her better on returning to Blue Cliffs, and then ran out of the room and down-stairs as fast as she could go.
<p>She had already taken leave of every member of the family except Emma Cavendish, who went out with her to the carriage, saw her comfortably seated in it, and kissed her good-bye.
<p>The little cavalcade then set forward.
<p>It was a lovely spring morning. The woods and fields were clothed with the freshest green; the mountain tops beamed in the most beautiful opal tints, and the blue sky was without a cloud.
<p>Laura enjoyed her drive very much.
<p>At Wendover they stopped to rest and water the horses, and then they resumed their journey and went on to Lytton Lodge, where they arrived just about noon.
<p>John Lytton was evidently on the lookout for his niece, for as the pony-carriage drove up, amid the barking of all the dogs and the shouting of all the little negroes, he rushed out of the house, throwing up his arms; and he caught Laura and lifted her bodily from her seat, roaring his welcome.
<p>And Laura, as she returned his honest, hearty greeting, felt a twinge of self-reproach in remembering with what reluctance she had come.
<p>Uncle John took her into the house and set her down in the hall in the midst of all her relations, who had crowded there to welcome here.
<p>"Lor-lor-lor', John! How dare you ma-ma-make so free as that with Laura, and she a young 'oman?" exclaimed old Mrs. Lytton, as, in her well-known faded calico gown and long-eared muslin cap, she came up and kissed her granddaughter.
<p>"Why, because she is a young 'oman, of course, and not an old man!" said John, saucily.
<p>"Why, how much you have improved, child!" said Miss Molly Moss, smiling blandly.
<p>"Oh, a'n't she though, neither?" exclaimed Octy and Ulky in a breath, as they seized her hands, the one clinging to her right and the other to her left.
<p>"Come, now, I think you had better let Laura go upstairs and take off her bonnet and things. Dinner's all ready to go on the table. And I reckon her appetite is ready also. And, Jacky, you had better go out and tell John Brooks to put up and feed them horses," said practical Aunt Kitty, as she took and faced Laura about toward the spare bed-room that was on the first floor.
<p>"Uncle wrote me that my brother was here. But I don't see him," said Laura as she laid off her bonnet.
<p>"No; he and Charley went to Perch Point fishing yesterday, intending to stay all night and come back this morning. I reckon they'll soon be here," said Aunt Kitty.
<p>Laura washed her face and hands and brushed her hair, put on clean collar and cuffs, and declared herself ready to join the family.
<p>Even as she spoke there was the hilarious bustle of an arrival in the hall outside.
<p>And as Laura emerged from the room she was caught in the arms of her brother Alden.
<p>"My darling sister, I am so delighted to see you!" said the young man, kissing her joyously.
<p>"So am I to see you, Alden, dear. But why didn't you accept Mrs. Cavendish's invitation to come and join our Easter party at Blue Cliffs?" inquired Laura.
<p>"My dear, because I thought my duty called me here," gravely replied Alden.
<p>"But for a day or two you might have joined us," persisted Laura.
<p>"No," said Alden. Then turning toward his red-headed fishing comrade he said: "Here's Cousin Charley waiting to welcome you, Laura."
<p>And Charley Lytton, blushing and stammering, held out his hand and said:
<p>"How do you do? I am very glad to see you."
<p>"And now come to dinner," said Aunt Kitty, opening the dining-room door.
<p>They all went in and sat down to as fine a dinner as was ever served in Blue Cliff Hall, or even at the Government House, although this was laid on a rough pine table, covered with a coarse, though clean linen table-cloth, and in a room where the walls were whitewashed and the floors were bare.
<p>"And now," said Uncle Jacky, as soon as he had served the turtle soup around to everybody, "I want you to tell me why you couldn't ride the gray mare, and why you came in a pony-carriage with a slap-up pair of bloods?"
<p>"Why, you know, I am a good-for-nothing city-bred girl, Uncle John, and Miss Cavendish knew it and doubted my ability to ride eighteen or twenty miles on horseback, and so insisted on my having the pony-carriage," explained Laura, soothingly.
<p>"Well, I'm glad it was no worse. I was thinking may be as you despised the old family mare," said John, somewhat mollified.
<p>"Oh, no, uncle! Quite the contrary. I did not feel equal to her," laughed Laura.
<p>"Well, when must we send that fine equipage back - to-night or tomorrow?"
<p>"Neither, Uncle John. It is not wanted at Blue Cliffs just at present. They have the barouche, the brougham and the gig. They can easily spare the pony-chaise. And Emma insisted on my keeping it here until I should be ready to return. And I promised her that I would do it."
<p>"Now I don't like that. That is a patternizing of us a great deal too much. We've got a carriage of our own, I reckon," said John, sitting back in his chair and lifting his red head pompously.
<p>"Now-now-now, John Lytton, don't you be a foo-foo-fool! Carriage! Why, our carriage is all to pieces! A'n't been fit to use for this six months! And sin-sin-since the Caverndishers have been so obleeging as to lend the loan of the pony-shay to Laura, I say let her keep it till she goes back. And while it's a staying here idle I can use it to go and see some of my neighbors," said old Mrs. Lytton, in that peremptory way of hers that did not brook contradiction from any one - even from the master of the house.
<p>Laura Lytton staid two days with her relatives at Lytton Lodge, and was just turning over in her mind the difficult subject of breaking the news of her immediate departure to Uncle Jacky, whom she felt sure would bitterly oppose it, when, on the evening of the second day, she received a surprise in the form of a call from Craven Kyte.
<p>The visitor was shown into the big parlor, where all the family, except Alden and Charley, were assembled, and engaged in cheerful conversation around the evening lamp.
<p>He came in bowing, shook hands with everybody, and then took the seat that was offered him and drew a letter from his pocket, saying, humorously:
<p>"In these latter days, when every one has a mission, it seems to me that my mission is to fetch and carry letters. I happened to call at Blue Cliffs this morning and to mention while there that I was going to White Perch Point and should take Lytton Lodge in my way, and would carry any message that was desired to Miss Laura Lytton, who I understood was on a visit there. And then Miss Cavendish requested me to take a letter to you, which she sat down and wrote right off at once. And here it is, miss," he concluded, placing the letter in Laura's hands.
<p>Laura asked leave of her company, and then opened the envelope and read as follows:
<p>"Blue Cliffs, Thursday afternoon.
<p>"My Dearest Laura: - The opportune arrival of Mr. Craven Kyte, on his way to White Perch Point and Lytton Lodge, furnishes me with the means of communicating with you sooner than I could manage to do by mail.
<p>"You will be very much surprised at what I am about to tell you.
<p>"Mary Grey has left Blue Cliffs.
<p>"She left so suddenly that I scarcely yet can realize that she has gone.
<p>"My grandmother and myself opposed her departure most earnestly. We used every means in the world but absolute force to keep her here.
<p>"But she would go. She said her health and spirits required the change. You know she was ailing when you left here.
<p>"Well, she has gone to Charlottesville, where she says she has some lady friend who keeps a boarding-house for the students of the University. So if your brother returns to the University he may have an opportunity of renewing his very pleasant acquaintance with her. I do not know when, if ever, she will return.
<p>"Of course this is her home whenever she pleases to come back. But I strongly suspect the pretty little widow has grown tired of our country house.
<p>"You know she has really no resources within herself for enjoyment. She cares nothing for the beautiful scenery surrounding our home, nor for gardening, nor reading, nor visiting and instructing the poor negroes; nor, in short, for anything that makes a remote country place enjoyable. And so she has left us - 'It may be for years, and it may be for ever,' as the song says.
<p>"But, my darling, don't you desert me just at this time. Come back, according to your promise. I am wearying for you. Tell that excessively affectionate and hospitable Uncle John that I need you so much more than he does. Or show him this letter. All the Lyttons are gallant and chivalrous gentlemen. He is no exception, and he will not oppose my wish, I feel sure. I shall expect you at Blue Cliffs to-morrow evening.
<p>"My grandmother has just directed me to repeat her invitation to Mr. Alden Lytton, and to ask him to accompany you back to Blue Cliffs and make us a visit. I hope he will do so. Mind, I shall expect you both to-morrow evening. Pray present my respects to Mr. and Mrs. Lytton and all their kind family. And believe me, dearest Laura,
<p>"Ever your own
<p>"Emma.
<p>"Postscript. - I have some strange news to tell you which I can not trust upon paper. I also expect a new inmate in the family. I will explain when you come.      E."
<p>Laura folded her letter and put it into her pocket for the present.
<p>"They want you to come back, I suppose," said Uncle John, testily.
<p>"I will show you the letter presently, uncle, so you can read and judge for yourself," said Laura, with a smile.
<p>"Well, all I say is this: if they want you to come back want will be their master. For they can't have you; so there now! I don't mean to let you leave us until you are obliged to go back to school. I don't that!" said John, nodding his big red head.
<p>"Did you know Mrs. Grey had left Blue Cliffs?" sorrowfully inquired Mr. Kyte.
<p>"Yes. Emma has written to me about her departure. When did she go?"
<p>"Early this morning. When I got to the house I was very much disappointed at not seeing her, and beyond measure astonished to hear that she had started that very morning to Wendover, to catch the first train to the city, en route for Charlottesville. She will be a great loss to the domestic circle at Blue Cliffs, I think."
<p>"And who the mischief is Mrs. Grey?" inquired the sorely puzzled Uncle John.
<p>"She was one of the assistant teachers - the drawing-mistress, in fact - at Mount Ascension. But she lost her situation there. And she became the guest of Emma Cavendish. Afterward she was engaged to Mr. Cavendish. But his death prevented the marriage," Laura explained.
<p>And at this point of the conversation "Mandy" made her appearance at the door and said that supper was on the table.
<p>And old Mrs. Lytton arose and invited the company to follow her to the dining-room.
<p>After supper, as it was a clear, mild, star-lit evening, Mr. Craven Kyte remounted his horse and resumed his journey to White Perch Point.
<p>After his departure, when the family were once more assembled in the big parlor, Laura took her letter out and put it in the hands of John Lytton.
<p>Uncle Jacky read it through, and then quoted a part of it to the family circle.
<p>"'Tell that affectionate and hospitable Uncle John that I need you so much more than he does. Or show him this letter. All the Lyttons are gallant and chivalrous gentlemen.' That's so!" put in Uncle Jacky, nodding his red head. "'He is no exception. And he will not oppose my wish, I feel sure.' Now that is what I call taking a fellow at a disadvantage!" growled John, holding the letter before his eyes and staring at it. "Well, I suppose I must let you go, Laura, seeing she makes such a point of it. But they want Alden, too. And Alden they can't have! Where is the fellow, anyhow? And why wasn't he at supper?"
<p>"He and Charley are down at Uncle Bob's house, getting bait for another fishing match to-morrow. I told Mandy to keep the supper hot for them," answered Aunt Kitty.
<p>And soon after this the little family, who kept very early hours, separated to go to rest.
<p>Laura and her two cousins were the first to leave the room.
<p>Aunt Kitty and Miss Molly followed.
<p>When they were gone old Mrs. Lytton turned upon her son and said:
<p>"Jacky, I ho-ho-hope you a'n't a goin' to be sich a contrairy fool as to stand into the light of your own flesh and blood?"
<p>"Why, what the mischief do you mean, mother? I a'n't a standing into nobody's light, much less my own flesh and blood's!" exclaimed John, raising his red head.
<p>"Yes-yes-yes, you are too! You're a standing into your own dear nephew's, Alden Lytton's, light, in opposing of his going to Blue Cliffs along of his sister to-morrow," complained the old lady.
<p>"Riddle-me-riddle-me-ree! I know no more of what you're talking than the fish of Zuyder Zee!"
<p>"Why-why-why then this is what I'm a talking about. Can-can-can't you see that Emma Cavendish is perfectly wrapped up in Laura Lytton? She's as fon-fon-fond of her as ever she can be. And Emma Cavendish is the most beau-beau-beautiful girl and the richest heiress in the whole state. And Alden Lytton is one of the han-han-handsomest young men I ever saw. And if he goes with his sister to Blue Cliffs - don't you see?"
<p>"No, I don't," said honest, obtuse John.
<p>"Well, then, the gal that is so fond of the sis-sis-sister might grow to be equally fond of the handsome bro-bro-brother. Now do you see?"
<p>"Oh, I see!" exclaimed John, with a look of profound enlightenment.
<p>"And I hope you won't go and stand into the light of your own dear nephew by raising up of any objections to his going along of his sister to Blue Cliffs," added the old lady.
<p>"I stand in the light of my own poor, dear, dead brother's son! 'Tain't likely!" exclaimed Uncle Jacky, with an injured air.
<p>"No, John, I don't think it is. And so, I hope, instead of oppo-po-po-opposing on him, you'll encourage him to go along of his sister to Blue Cliffs to-morrow," said the old lady.
<p>"Mother, I shall do what is right," answered John.
<p>"And lookee here, Jacky! Don't you let on to Alden that any on us have such a thought as him going there to court the heiress, for ef you do, he's so high and mighty he'd see us all furder fust before he'd budge a step to go to Blue Cliffs, sister or no sister. So mind what I tell you, John."
<p>"Mother, I will do all that is right," repeated John, with pompous dignity.
<p>"I only hope as you will. And so good-night, my son," said the old woman, as she lighted her bed-room taper and left the room.
<p>Laura came down-stairs early the next morning, and found her brother alone in the big parlor.
<p>And then she showed him Emma Cavendish's letter.
<p>And when he had read it through, she said, quite piteously:
<p>"Alden, I do want to go back and spend the rest of the Easter holidays at Blue Cliffs, for I love Emma Cavendish better than anybody else in the whole world except yourself. And I hate to disappoint her. But I equally hate to leave you, Alden. So I do wish you would make up your mind to accept Mrs. Cavendish's invitation and accompany me to Blue Cliffs."
<p>"Why-why-why of course he will go, Laura! Do you 'spect your own dear brother is a going to let you go off alone, by your own self, of a journey, when he's invi-vi-vited to go along of you?" exclaimed old Mrs. Lytton, who entered at that moment, and spoke up before Alden Lytton could either accept or refuse.
<p>"Certainly he will. Why, nephew's a gentleman, I reckon, and he wouldn't refuse to escort his own dear sister, when he is requested to do so," added Uncle John, as he strode into the room.
<p>Alden Lytton smiled and bowed.
<p>In truth, now that the secret obstacle to his visit to Blue Cliffs was removed by the departure of Mrs. Grey for an indefinitely long absence, he felt no objection at all to accompanying his sister thither. So, still smiling, he answered:
<p>"Why, you all seem to think that I shall make some difficulty about complying with my sister's wishes. But I shall do nothing of the sort. On the contrary, I shall attend my sister with great pleasure."
<p>"That's you!" exclaimed old Mrs. Lytton.
<p>"Bully boy!" heartily cried Uncle Jacky.
<p>"I thank you, Alden," said Laura, quietly, giving him her hand.
<p>"Yes, that's all very well; but - " began Charley, who had joined the circle.
<p>"But what? What's the matter with you?" demanded his father.
<p>Charley, seeing all eyes turned upon him, and most especially Laura's, blushed crimson and remained silent.
<p>"I had arranged to go with Charley this morning to fish for trout in the Mad River," laughingly explained Alden.
<p>"Oh, well, it can't be helped! You feel disappointed, of course, my boy; but everything must give way to the will of the ladies, Charley. 'All the Lyttons are gallant and chivalrous gentlemen,'" said Uncle Jacky, proudly, quoting the words of Emma's letter. "And we are no exception to the rule. Miss Cavendish is anxious for the society of Laura. Laura wishes the escort of her brother, who has also been invited to Blue Cliffs. We must not oppose the will of the ladies," concluded John, bowing to his niece with pompous deference.
<p>Poor Charley blushed purpler than ever, and holding down his red head - like his father's - he mumbled something about "not wishing to oppose no ladies whatsoever."
<p>"Now, then, what time are you expected at Blue Cliffs?" inquired Uncle Jacky, turning to Laura.
<p>"This evening, uncle. Don't you remember? You read the letter."
<p>"Oh, yes! Well, then, you needn't leave till after dinner, Kitty," he called to his wife, "order dinner for twelve o'clock noon, sharp! I want Alden and Laura, if they must leave, to go with full stomachs: do you hear?"
<p>"Why of course, Jacky! Don't we always have dinner at twelve o'clock?" laughingly inquired Aunt Kitty.
<p>"Well, then, mind that to-day a'n't an exception to the rule. Now where's that boy Taters?"
<p>"Here I am, Marse John," said Mithridates, making his appearance with an armful of wood, which he threw upon the fire; for the April morning was chilly.
<p>"Taters," said Uncle John, "you see to having the pony-chaise at the door at half-past twelve precisely to take Mr. Alden and Miss Laura to Blue Cliffs."
<p>"Yes, Marse John."
<p>"And, Taters, you saddle Brown Bill to ride and wait on them. You hear?"
<p>Taters turned dark-gray and staggered to a chair and sat down.
<p>"Why, what's the matter with the fool now?" demanded Uncle John.
<p>"Oh, Marse John, don't send me to Blue Cliffs no more, sir - please don't!"
<p>"Why - why shouldn't I send you there, you idiot?"
<p>"Oh, Marse John, I done see the sperrit of my young mist'ess there; and if I see it ag'in I shall die - 'deed I shall, sir!" exclaimed the shuddering boy.
<p>"What the mischief does he mean, Laura? You look as if you understood him," inquired John Lytton.
<p>Laura laughingly told the story of the supposed spirit, adding that it must have been a pure hallucination on the part of the boy.
<p>"Well, anyhow, I'll not send him with you if he's takin' to makin' a fool of himself. It wouldn't do, you know," said John.
<p>"And really, uncle, we need no one at all as an outrider," said Laura.
<p>After an early and substantial dinner, Alden and Laura took leave of their kind relatives and entered the pony-carriage, whose dashing little grays, driven by old Jerome, were to take them to Blue Cliffs.
<p>But we must precede them thither, to find out what it was that had driven Mary Grey from the house in such very great haste.
<p>It was on the evening of the very same day that saw the departure of Laura Lytton for Lytton Lodge that Peter, the post-office messenger of Blue Cliffs, returned from Wendover, bringing with him a well-filled mail-bag.
<p>He took it into the drawing-room, where Miss Cavendish and her guests, the Rev. Dr. Jones, Miss Electra, and Mrs. Grey, were gathered around the center-table, under the light of the chandelier.
<p>Emma Cavendish unlocked the mail-bag and turned its contents out upon the table.
<p>"Newspapers and magazines only, I believe. No letters. Help yourselves, friends. There are paper-knives on the pen-tray. And in the absence of letters, there is a real pleasure in unfolding a fresh newspaper and cutting the leaves of a new magazine," said the young lady, as she returned the empty bag to the messenger.
<p>But her companions tumbled over the mail still in the vain hope of finding letters.
<p>"None for me; yet I did hope to get one from my new manager at Beresford Manors," muttered Dr. Jones, in a tone of disappointment.
<p>"And none for me either, though I do think the girls at Mount Ascension might write to me," pouted Electra.
<p>"And of course there are none for me! There never are! No one ever writes to me. The poor have no correspondents. I did not expect a letter, and I am not disappointed," murmured Mary Grey, with that charming expression, between a smile and a sigh, that she had always found so effective.
<p>"Well, there is no letter for any one, it seems, so none of us have cause to feel slighted by fortune more than others," added Emma Cavendish, cheerfully.
<p>But Peter, the post-office boy, looked from one to the other, with his black eyes growing bigger and bigger, as he felt with his hand in the empty mail-bag and exclaimed:
<p>"I'clar's to de law der was a letter for some uns. Miss Emmer, 'cause I see de pos'marser put it in de bag wid his own hands, which it were a letter wid a black edge all 'round de outside of it, and a dob o' black tar, or somethink, onto the middle o' the back of it."
<p>As the boy spoke, the Rev. Dr. Jones began again to turn over the magazines and newspapers until he found the letter, which had slipped between the covers of the Edinboro' Review.
<p>"It is for you, my dear," he said, as he passed the missive across the table to Miss Cavendish.
<p>"I wonder from whom it comes? The handwriting is quite unfamiliar to me. And the postmark is New York, where I have no correspondents whatever," said Emma, in surprise, as she broke the black seal.
<p>"Oh, maybe it's a circular from some merchant who has heard of the great Alleghany heiress," suggested Electra.
<p>"You will permit me?" said Emma, glancing at her companions as she unfolded her letter.
<p>And then, as one and another nodded and smiled and returned to their magazines and papers. Emma Cavendish glanced at the signature of her strange letter, started with surprise, gazed at it a second time more attentively, and then turned hurriedly and began to read it.
<p>And as she read her face paled and flushed, and she glanced from time to time at the faces of her companions; but they were all engaged with pamphlets and papers, except Mrs. Grey, whom Emma perceived to be furtively watching her.
<p>The strange letter was written in rather a wild and rambling style of composition, as if the writer were a little brain sick. It ran as follows:
<p>"Blank Hotel, New York City, April 27th, 18 - .
<p>"My dear Miss Cavendish: - Our near blood relationship might warrant me in addressing you as my dear Emma. But I refrain, because you would not understand the familiarity any more than you recognize this handwriting, which must seem as strange to you as my face would seem if I were to present myself bodily before you; for you have never set eyes upon me, and perhaps have never even heard my name mentioned or my existence alluded to.
<p>"And yet I am one of your family, near of kindred to yourself; in fact, your own dear mother's only sister.
<p>Yes, she was literally so. Your mother was a beautiful blonde, as I have been told that you, her only child, also are. I am - or, rather, I was before my hair turned white with sorrow - a very dark brunette.
<p>"If you have ever heard of me at all, which I doubt - for I know that at home my once loved and cherished name
<p>but if you ever heard of me at all you must have heard of that willful love marriage which separated me from all my family.
<p>"Since that ill-omened marriage an unbroken succession of misfortunes have attended my husband and myself until they culminated in the most crushing calamity of our lives - the loss of our dear and only daughter in a manner worse than death.
<p>"Soon after that awful bereavement our creditors foreclosed the mortgage on our estate at White Perch Point, and sold the place over our heads.
<p>"And my poor husband and myself went out to California, childless and almost penniless, to begin life anew.
<p>"We began in a very humble way indeed. As he was familiar with hotel business he got a place as bar-tender in a San Francisco hotel; and soon afterward I got a place in the same house, to look after and keep in repair the bed and table linen. And we lodged in the hotel, in a small attic chamber, and took our meals in the pantry.
<p>"But we were both utterly broken down in mind and body, as well as in estate.
<p>"He soon sank into a consumption and had to give up his place. I hired a room in a small house and took him to it. I still retained my place at the hotel, because my salary there was the only support we had. But I lived there no longer. I used to go in the morning, make the daily inspection of the linen, and bring home what needed mending; and working all the afternoon and half the night at my husband's bedside.
<p>"But rent and food and fuel, physic and physicians' fees were very costly in San Francisco. And with all my work I fell deeper and deeper into debt.
<p>"At length my poor husband died. And it took the proceeds of the sale of all our little personal effects to pay for the humblest sort of funeral.
<p>"And I was left entirely destitute. Then my courage gave way. I wept myself so blind that I could no longer mend the linen at the hotel, or even see whether it wanted mending. Then I fell sick with sorrow and had to be taken to the hospital.
<p>"At the end of three months I was dismissed. But where could I go? What could I do, broken in health and nearly blind as I was?
<p>"I must have perished then and there but for the timely assistance of a young gold-digger who happened to hear about me when he came up to the city from his distant mining-camp.
<p>"He was a very queer young man, whom his few friends called crazy on account of his lonely and ascetic manner of life, and his lavish liberality.
<p>"He sought me out to relieve my wants. And upon my telling him that all I wanted was to go home to die, he bought me a whole state-room to myself in the first cabin of the 'Golden City,' bound from San Francisco to New York. And then he bought me an outfit in clothing, good enough for a duke's widow. And he gave me a sum of money besides, and started me fairly and comfortably on my voyage.
<p>"I reached New York three days ago. But my strength continues to fail and my funds to waste. I have no power to work, even if I could procure anything to do. And I have not money enough to support me a month longer.
<p>"I do not like to go into an alms-house. Yet what am I to do?
<p>"But why do I write to you? you may naturally inquire.
<p>"Why? Because, although a perfect stranger, you are, after all, my niece, my only sister's only child, my own only blood relation. And 'blood is thicker than water.'
<p>"'I can not work; to beg I am ashamed.'
<p>"I do not, therefore, beg, even of you. I do not so much as make any suggestion to you. I tell you the facts of the case, and I leave you to act upon them, or to ignore them entirely, at your pleasure.
<p>"I do not even know whether I may venture to sign myself your aunt,
<p>Katherine Fanning."
<p>Emma Cavendish read this letter through to the end; then she glanced at her companions, who were still all absorbed in the perusal of their journals.
<p>Even Mrs. Grey was now lost in a magazine; but it was Les Modes de Paris, and contained plates and descriptions of all the new spring fashions.
<p>So Miss Cavendish, seeing her friends all agreeably occupied and amused, returned to her singular letter and recommenced and read it carefully through to the end once more.
<p>At the conclusion of the second reading she looked up and spoke to the Rev. Dr. Jones, saying:
<p>"Are you reading anything very interesting in that Quarterly Review, my dear uncle?"
<p>"Well, yes, my child - an article entitled 'Have Animals Reason?'"
<p>"Reason for what?" naïvely inquired Mary Grey, looking up from her magazine of fashion.
<p>Every one smiled except Dr. Jones, who condescended to explain that the subject under discussion was whether animals were gifted with reasoning faculties.
<p>"Oh!" said Mrs. Grey, and returned to her Modes.
<p>"You needn't read any more on that subject, grandpa; I can answer that question for you, or any other inquirer. All intelligent animals, whether they go upon two feet or four, or upon wings or fins, have reason just in proportion to their intelligence. And all idiotic animals, whether they go upon two feet or four, or wings or fins, lack reason just in proportion to their idiocy. Lor'! why I have seen human creatures at the Idiot Asylum with less intellect than cats. And I have seen some horses with more intelligence than some legislators. You can't generalize on these subjects, grandpa," said Miss Electra, with an air of conviction.
<p>The Rev. Dr. Jones stared, much as a hen might stare to see her own ducklings take to the water. And then he turned to Emma Cavendish and said:
<p>"Whether animals have reason or not, my dear, you had some reason for interrupting me. Now what was it?"
<p>"To ask you to read this, sir," said Miss Cavendish, putting her letter in the hands of her uncle.
<p>He took it and read it slowly through, muttering from time to time:
<p>"Dear, dear, how distressing! Bless my soul alive! Well, well, well!"
<p>And he glanced uneasily at Mary Grey, who fidgeted and flushed under his observation.
<p>At length he finished and folded the letter and returned it to Miss Cavendish, with the inquiry:
<p>"Well, my dear, what are you going to do in the premises?"
<p>"I shall write immediately and ask my aunt to come here and make this her home," answered Emma, promptly.
<p>At these words Mary Grey started, caught her breath with a gasp, and quickly whirled her chair around so as to bring her back to the light and throw her face in deep shadow.
<p>"What's the matter with you?" inquired Electra.
<p>"The light makes my eyes ache; that is all. You know I have not quite got rid of my cold yet," answered the widow in a low, faltering tone that might have attracted the attention of Miss Cavendish had not that young lady's thoughts been engaged with the subject of her letter.
<p>"You will consult your grandmother before making this important addition to the household, I presume?" inquired the old gentleman.
<p>"Yes, of course; but I am certain beforehand of my dear grandma's consent and co-operation in such an evident Christian duty," answered Miss Cavendish.
<p>And then she turned to her young friends, to whom she thought some explanation was due, and she added:
<p>"I have news in this letter that has much surprised and pained me. It is from my aunt, Mrs. Fanning. She has lost her husband, and has suffered very severe reverses of fortune. She is at this time alone in New York City, and in failing health. I shall write for her to come and live with us. And not to leave her a day in suspense, I shall telegraph from Wendover to-morrow morning."
<p>"I'm glad she's coming. The more the merrier," said Electra, gayly.
<p>Mrs. Grey said nothing. She arose as if to leave the room, tottered forward and fell to the floor in a dead swoon.
<p>All started to their feet and rushed to the prostrate woman's assistance.
<p>She was but a slight creature, and Dr. Jones lifted her easily and laid her on one of the sofas.
<p>Electra flew upstairs to bring down a bottle of Florida water.
<p>Emma patted and rubbed her hands.
<p>Dr. Jones bathed her brow with cold water, sighing and muttering to himself:
<p>"Poor girl! Poor unfortunate girl!"
<p>"I take blame to myself," said Emma. "She is evidently much iller than I thought. I ought not to have persuaded her to leave her room so soon after her cold. It is my fault."
<p>At that instant Electra ran in with the Florida water and dashed a liberal portion of it over the head and face of the fainting woman.
<p>The shock and the penetrating odor combined to rouse her from insensibility; and with a few gasps she recovered her consciousness; though her face, after one sudden flush, settled into a deadly paleness.
<p>"My poor dear, how are you?" inquired Emma Cavendish, kindly.
<p>"Dying, I think; dying, I hope! Let some one help me to my room," she murmured.
<p>Dr. Jones at once lifted her in his arms and bore her upstairs, preceded by Electra, who flew on before to show the way to Mary Grey's room, and followed by Emma Cavendish, who still blamed herself for the invalid's supposed relapse.
<p>Dr. Jones laid her on her bed, and was about to leave her to the care of Emma and Electra, when she seized his hand and drew him down to her face and said:
<p>"I wish to speak to you for a moment now. Send Miss Cavendish and Miss Coroni out of the room for a little while."
<p>"My dear children, go away for a moment. Mrs. Grey wishes to speak to me alone," said Dr. Jones.
<p>And Emma and Electra softly retired, with the belief that Mary Grey only wished to consult the minister on religious subjects.
<p>As soon as the door was closed behind them Mary Grey seized the old man's hand and, fixing her great black eyes fiercely upon him, demanded:
<p>"Do they suspect?"
<p>"No; certainly not."
<p>"Did you drop no word during my swoon that might have led them to suspect?"
<p>"Not one syllable."
<p>"I thank you then!" she exclaimed, with a long sigh of relief.
<p>"But, my child, was that all you wished to talk to me about?"
<p>"That was all, except this: to beg you still to be silent as the grave in regard to my identity."
<p>"My child, your words disappoint and grieve me. I did hope that you asked this private interview with the design to consult me about the propriety of making yourself known."
<p>"Making myself known!" she exclaimed, with a half-suppressed shriek, as she started up upon her elbow and stared at the speaker. "Making myself known!"
<p>"The opportunity, my dear child, is such an excellent one. And, of course, you know that if Mrs. Fanning comes here - as she must; for there is no other refuge open to her - if she comes and finds you here, discovery is inevitable."
<p>"But she will not find me here! She shall not! I could not look her in the face. Sooner than do that, I will hurl myself from the turnpike bridge into the Mad River!" she fiercely exclaimed.
<p>"My child, do not talk so wickedly. It is frightful to hear such things!" cried the old man, shuddering.
<p>"You will see such things, if you do not mind. I am quite capable of doing what I said, for I am tired and sick of this life of constant dependence, mortification and terror - an insupportable life!" she wildly exclaimed.
<p>"Because, my poor girl, it is a life of concealment, in constant dread of discovery and the humiliation attending discovery. Change all that and your life will be happier. Trust in those who are nearest to you, and make yourself, your name, your errors, and your sufferings and repentance fully known. Emma Cavendish is the ruling power in this house, and she is a pure, noble, magnanimous spirit. She would protect you," pleaded the old man, taking her hand.
<p>"Oh, yes, she is all that! Do you think that makes it any easier for me to shock her with the story of my own folly, weakness and cowardice? Oh, no, no! I could not bear the look of her clear, truthful blue eyes! And I would not! There; it is useless to talk to me, Doctor Jones! There are some things that I can not do. I can not stay here!"
<p>"My poor, poor child, whither will you go? Stay! Now I think of it, I can send you to my house at Beresford Manors. That shall be your home, if you will accept it. But what excuse can you make for leaving this place so abruptly?"
<p>"You are very kind, Doctor Jones. You are very kind. But a moment's reflection will teach you that I could not accept your hospitality. You have no lady, I believe, at Beresford Manors? No one there except the colored servants? Therefore, you see, it would not be proper for me to go there," said Mary Grey, affecting a prudery that she did not feel, and objecting to the place only because she did not choose to bury herself in a house more lonely, dreary and deserted, if possible, than Blue Cliff Hall itself.
<p>"Then where can you go, my poor girl?" compassionately questioned the old minister.
<p>"I have thought of that. Sudden as this emergency is, I am not quite unprepared for it. This crisis that I feared might come has come, that is all. Only it has come in a far different manner from what I feared. But the result must be the same. I must leave the house immediately. And you must help to smooth my way toward leaving it."
<p>"But whither will you go, poor shorn lamb?"
<p>"I have planned out all that, in view of this very contingency. I will go to Charlottesville, where I have a lady friend who keeps a boarding-house for the University students. I can stay with her, and make myself useful in return for board and lodging, until I get something to do for a living. That is all settled. I asked you for this interview only to satisfy myself that no hint of my identity had been dropped, and no suspicion of it excited, during my swoon; and, further, to beg you to keep my miserable secret hereafter, as you have hitherto."
<p>"I have satisfied you, I hope, upon all those subjects."
<p>"Yes; and I thank you."
<p>"But still I can not abandon the hope that you will yet heed good counsel and make yourself known to your best friends," pleaded the old man.
<p>But Mary Grey shook her head.
<p>Dr. Jones coaxed, argued, lectured, all in vain.
<p>At length, worn out by his importunities, Mary Grey, to gain her own ends, artfully replied:
<p>"Well, dear, good, wise friend, if ever I do gain courage to make myself known to my family, I must do it from some little distance, and by letter, so as to give them time to get over the shock of the revelation, before I could dare to face them. Think of it yourself. How could we bear to look each other in the eyes while telling and hearing such a story?"
<p>"I believe you are right so far. Yes, in that view of the case it is, perhaps, better that you should go away and then write," admitted Dr. Jones.
<p>"And you will aid me in my efforts to get away at once and without opposition? Tell them that it is better for my health and spirits that I should go away for a while, and go immediately - as it really is, you know. Will you do this?"
<p>"Yes, I will do it, in the hope that your nervous system may be strengthened, and you may find courage to do the duty that lies before you," said the doctor, as he pressed her hand and left the room.
<p>Dr. Jones went down-stairs to the drawing-room, where the young ladies waited in anxious suspense.
<p>Emma Cavendish arose and looked at him in silent questioning.
<p>"There is no cause for alarm, my dear Emma. Your friend will do very well. No, you need not go up to her room. She requires absolutely nothing but to be left to repose. You can look in on her, if you like, just before you go to bed. That will be time enough," explained Dr. Jones, as he took his seat at the table and took up his Review again as if nothing had happened to interrupt his reading.
<p>Emma Cavendish breathed a sigh of relief and resumed her seat. She and Electra read or conversed in a low voice over their magazines until the hour of retiring.
<p>Electra was the first to close her pamphlet, as with an undisguised yawn, for which her school-mistress would have rebuked her, she declared that she could not keep her eyes open a minute longer, much less read a line, and that she was going to bed.
<p>Dr. Jones, with as much courtesy as if he had not been her grandfather, arose and lighted her bedroom candle and put it in her hand.
<p>And she kissed him a drowsy good-night and went upstairs.
<p>Emma was about to follow, when the doctor motioned her to resume her seat.
<p>She did so, and waited.
<p>"I want a word with you about Mrs. Grey, my dear Emma. She is very much out of health."
<p>"I feared so," replied Emma Cavendish.
<p>"Or, to speak with more literal truth, I should say that her nervous system is very much disordered."
<p>"Yes."
<p>"She is full of sick fancies. She wishes to go away for a while to get a change of scene."
<p>"I will go with her to any watering-place she desires to visit, in the season," said Emma Cavendish, readily.
<p>"Yes; but, my dear, she must have this change now, immediately."
<p>"I would go with her now if I could leave my guests. You know I have Electra here, and Laura will return in two days perhaps, with her brother also."
<p>"My good child, she does not ask or need any attendance. She wants to go away by herself for a while. She wants to go to an old lady friend in Charlottesville."
<p>"I have heard her lately speak of such a friend, and of her intention, some day, to visit her."
<p>"Well, she wishes to go now, immediately, but is afraid to mention her desire lest it should meet with opposition, which she has no nerve to contest."
<p>"Dear uncle, how strange that she should feel this way! Why, she is not a prisoner here! And if she wishes to leave us for a short or a long time she can do so."
<p>"Of coarse she can, my dear; but she is full of sick fancies. And my advice to you is that you let her go at once. To-morrow morning, if she wishes."
<p>"Why certainly, Uncle Beresford! I have neither the power nor the will to prevent her."
<p>"So let it be then, my dear. And now good-night," said the doctor, taking his candle to leave the room.
<p>Thus the matter was settled.
<p>But the next day old Mrs. Cavendish, Electra, and, in fact, the whole house, were thrown into a state of consternation at the announcement of Mrs. Grey's immediate departure.
<p>When or how she had managed to get her personal effects together, whether she had kept them packed up for the emergency, or whether she had sat up all night to pack them, I do not know; but it is certain that by seven o'clock that morning she had three enormous Saratoga trunks packed, strapped and locked ready for the wagon that she asked for to take them to the railway station.
<p>It was not until her luggage was in the wagon, and the carriage was waiting for her at the door, and she herself in her traveling-suit and hat, that she went to bid the old lady good-bye.
<p>Mrs. Cavendish had been informed by Emma of the intended abrupt departure of Mary Grey, and she had begun to oppose it with all her might.
<p>But Emma endeavored to convince her that the change was vitally necessary to Mary Grey's health and strength.
<p>So now when the traveler entered the old lady's room the latter feebly arose to her feet, holding on to the arm of her chair, while she faltered:
<p>"Mary - Mary, this is so sudden, so shocking, so sorrowful, that I almost think it will make me ill! Why must you go, my dear?"
<p>"Sweet mother - may I call you so? - sweet mother, I will tell you what I did not like to tell dear Emma, for fear it might distress her; she is so sensitive, you know!" murmured the siren, sitting down and tenderly caressing the old lady.
<p>"Tell me then, my love, tell me anything you like," said Mrs. Cavendish, weeping.
<p>"Well, you know that dear old lady friend in Charlottesville, of whom I spoke to you a week or so ago?"
<p>"Ah, yes! The bishop's widow, who is reduced to keeping a student's boarding-house to help support her fifteen children," sighed the ancient dame.
<p>"Yes, and my dear dead mother's dearest friend. Well, I have heard that she is in a dying condition and desires above all things to see me before she departs. That's what shocked me so severely as to make me quite ill. But I never should forgive myself if by any delay of mine she really should depart without having her last wish gratified. Do you blame me for hurrying away?"
<p>"No, no, no, my child - my own lovely child! I do not wonder my poor Charley worshiped you, you are so very good! Go, Mary, my darling! But hurry back as soon as possible."
<p>"Yes, sweet mother, I will. And now, not a word to Emma, or to any one else who might tell her of these distressing circumstances."
<p>"No, no; certainly not! How thoughtful you are, for one so young, my good child! Bend down and take my blessing."
<p>Mary Grey bowed her head.
<p>The venerable lady placed her withered hands upon the bent head, raised her eyes to heaven, and solemnly invoked a blessing on the traitress.
<p>And then Mary Grey arose, kissed her in silence, and left the room.
<p>And thus they parted.
<p>In the hall below she had to part with Emma and Electra.
<p>"We hope you will return to us very soon, dear Mrs. Grey," said Emma Cavendish, as she kissed her good-bye.
<p>"I hope so too, my dear," answered the widow.
<p>"But you will scarcely get back before I return to school, so ours must be a very long good-bye," said Electra, as she also kissed the "parting guest."
<p>"'Tis true, 'tis pity," said Mrs. Grey, between a smile and a sigh.
<p>Dr. Jones then handed her into the carriage, and followed and took a seat by her side, for he was to attend her to the station and see her off on her journey.
<p>When Emma Cavendish turned back into the house she went up into the old lady's room with the intention of breaking to her the news of Katherine Fanning's widowhood and destitution, and of her own desire to invite her to come and live at Blue Cliffs.
<p>She found Mrs. Cavendish just finishing her nice breakfast with Aunt Moll in attendance upon her.
<p>"Here, take away the service now," said the old lady, putting down her empty coffee-cup. "And now, Emma, I am very glad you have come. I feel quite low about parting with Mary. What an angel she is!"
<p>"Cheer up, grandma! We shall have another addition to our family circle soon," said Emma, pleasantly.
<p>"Who is coming, my dear?" inquired Mrs. Cavendish, with all the curiosity of a recluse.
<p>"Oh, another lady!" slowly answered Miss Cavendish, to give Aunt Moll time to get out of the room with her breakfast tray.
<p>And when the old woman had shut the door behind her, Emma said:
<p>"Dear grandma, you will be very much surprised to hear who it is that is coming."
<p>And when Mrs. Cavendish looked up surprised indeed, as well as somewhat alarmed, Emma began and told her of the letter she had received from Mrs. Fanning; of her widowhood and destitution, and of her recent arrival in New York.
<p>"All this is very distressing, my dear Emma, but you see in it only the natural consequences of a low marriage," said the old aristocrat.
<p>"But the marriage is broken by death, dear grandma, and the error is atoned for by much suffering," said Emma, gently.
<p>"Well, my dear, what does the poor woman want us to do?" inquired Mrs. Cavendish.
<p>"She asks nothing, grandma. She simply writes to me, her sister's child - "
<p>"Her half-sister's child!" haughtily interrupted the old lady.
<p>"It is the same thing, grandma. Her half-sister's child, and her only living relative - "
<p>"Her only living relative?" again interrupted the old lady. "Where is her own misguided daughter?"
<p>"Supposed to be dead, dear grandma. Certainly dead to her," said Emma, sadly.
<p>"Well, go on, child; go on."
<p>"She writes to me, I say, and tells me of her situation - widowed, childless, homeless and utterly destitute in a strange city; but she asks nothing - suggests nothing."
<p>"Well, and what would you do - you, her only living relative?" inquired the ancient dame in a tone approaching sarcasm.
<p>"I would restore to her all that she has lost, if I could. I would give her back husband, daughter, home and competence," said Emma.
<p>"But you can't do it any more than you can give her back her lost caste," interrupted the old lady.
<p>Emma felt discouraged but did not yield her point.
<p>"No, dear grandma," she answered, sorrowfully, "I can not give her back her husband, her child, or her wealth; but I can give my mother's suffering sister a home and a friend."
<p>Madam Cavendish lowered her gold-rimmed spectacles from her cap frills to her eyes, placed her lace-mittened hands on the arms of her chair and looked straight and steadily into the face of her granddaughter.
<p>It was extremely disheartening, and Emma dropped her eyes before that severe gaze and bowed her head meekly.
<p>But Emma, though she was the young girl, was in the right; and Madam Cavendish, though she was an ancient and venerable dame, was in the wrong.
<p>Emma knew this quite well, and in the argument that ensued she lovingly, respectfully, yet unflinchingly, maintained her point.
<p>At length Madam Cavendish yielded, saying, scornfully: "Well, my dear, it is more your affair than mine. Invite her here if you will. I wash my hands of it. Only don't ask me to be intimate with the inn-keeper's widow; for I won't. And that's all about it."
<p>"My dear grandma, you shall never see or hear of her, if you do not like to do so. You seldom leave your two rooms. And she shall never enter either unless you send for her," answered Emma.
<p>"So be it then, my dear. And now let me go to sleep. I always want to go to sleep after an argument," said Madam Cavendish, closing her eyes and sinking back in her arm-chair.
<p>Emma Cavendish stooped and kissed her, and then left the room.
<p>In fifteen minutes after she had written and dispatched to the office at Wendover a telegram to this effect:
<p>"Blue Cliffs, April 29th, 18 -
<p>"Dear Aunt: - Come home to me here as soon as possible. I will write to-day.
<p>Emma Cavendish."
<p>And in the course of that day she did write a kind and comforting letter to the bereaved and suffering woman, expressing much sympathy with her in her affliction, inviting her to come and live at Blue Cliffs for the rest of her life, and promising all that an affectionate niece could do to make her life easy and pleasant.
<p>Miss Cavendish had but just finished this letter, when Mr. Craven Kyte was announced.
<p>Emma, who was always kind to the ward of her late father, at once received him and sent for Electra to help to entertain him.
<p>But notwithstanding the presence of two beautiful girls, one the fairest blonde, the other the brightest brunette, and both kind and affable in their manners to him, the young man was restless and anxious, until at length, with fierce blushes and faltering tones, he expressed a hope that Mrs. Grey was well, and made an inquiry if she were in.
<p>Electra laughed.
<p>Emma told him that Mrs. Grey had gone for change of air to Charlottesville, and would be absent for some time. She also added - although the young man had not once thought of inquiring for Miss Lytton - that Laura had likewise gone to visit her uncle's family at Lytton Lodge.
<p>The foolish young victim of the widow's false wiles looked very much disappointed and depressed, yet had sense enough left him to remember to say that, as he himself was on the road to Perch Point and should take Lytton Lodge on his way, he would be happy to convey any letter or message from the ladies of Blue Cliffs to Miss Lytton.
<p>Emma thanked him and availed herself of his offer by sending a letter, as we have seen.
<p>And then she went about the house, attended by old Moll, selecting and arranging rooms for her new-expected guests.
<p>The next afternoon she was quite surprised by another call from Craven Kyte. He was shown into the parlor, where she sat at work with Electra.
<p>"You have come back quickly; but we are glad to see you," she said, as she arose to shake hands with him.
<p>"Yes, miss," he answered, after bowing to her and to Electra; "yes, miss, I reached Perch Point last night, and I left it early this morning. In going I called at Lytton Lodge and delivered your letter, miss."
<p>"The family at the lodge are well, I hope."
<p>"All well, miss. And as I passed by the gate this morning the man Taters, who was at work on the lawn, told me that Mr. Alden and Miss Laura Lytton would leave for this place at noon."
<p>"Then they will be here to-night," said Electra.
<p>"Yes, miss."
<p>"Will you stay and spend the afternoon and evening with us, Mr. Kyte? Shall I ring and have your horse put up?" inquired Miss Cavendish.
<p>"No, thank you, miss. I must get back to Wendover to-night. Fact is, I'm on the wing again," said the young man, stammering and blushing. "Business of importance calls me to - to Charlottesville, miss. So if you should have a letter or a message to send to - to Mrs. Grey I should be happy to take it."
<p>Emma Cavendish and Electra Coroni looked at each other in comic surprise.
<p>"Why, you must be an amateur postman, Mr. Kyte! To fetch and carry letters seems to be your mission on earth," laughed Electra.
<p>"So it has often been said of me, miss. And if you or Miss Cavendish have any to send, I should be happy to take them," answered the young man, quite seriously.
<p>"I have none," said Electra.
<p>"Nor I, thank you," added Emma; "but you may, if you please, give my love to Mrs. Grey, and tell her we shall feel anxious until we hear of her safe arrival and improved health."
<p>"I will do so with much pleasure," said Mr. Kyte, rising to take leave.
<p>As soon as the visitor had left them the two young ladies exchanged glances of droll amazement.
<p>"As sure as you live, Emma, the business of importance that takes him to Charlottesville is Mrs. Mary Grey! He's taken in and done for, poor wretch! I shouldn't wonder a bit if he sold out his share in the fancy dry-goods store at Wendover and invested all his capital in college fees and entered himself as a student at the University, for the sake of being near his enchantress," said Electra.
<p>"Poor boy!" sighed Emma, with genuine pity.
<p>And before they could exchange another word, the sound of carriage-wheels at the gate announced the arrival of Alden and Laura Lytton.
<p>Emma Cavendish, with her cheeks blooming and eyes beaming with pleasure, ran out to meet her friends.
<p>Alden and Laura Lytton, just admitted by the footman, stood within the hall.
<p>Miss Cavendish welcomed Laura with a kiss and Alden with a cordial grasp of the hand.
<p>"I am so delighted to see you, dear Laura; and you also, Mr. Lytton," she said, leading the way into the parlor.
<p>"Well as I like my kind relatives at Lytton Lodge, I am very glad to get back to you, Emma, dear, and that is the truth," answered Laura, as she sank into an arm-chair and began to draw off her gloves.
<p>Alden said nothing. He had bowed deeply in response to Miss Cavendish's words of welcome, and now he was thinking what a bright and beautiful creature she was, how full of healthful, joyous life she seemed, and wondering that he had never noticed all this before.
<p>But he had noticed it before. When he first saw Emma Cavendish in her father's house in the city he had thought her the most heavenly vision of loveliness that had ever beamed upon mortal eyes; and he would have continued to think so had not the baleful beauty of Mary Grey glided before him and beguiled his sight and his soul.
<p>But Mary Grey was gone with all her magic arts, and the very atmosphere seemed clearer and brighter for her absence.
<p>"As soon as you have rested a little come up to your room, Laura, and lay on your wraps. Tea will be ready by the time we come down again. And, Mrs. Lytton, your old attendant, Jerome, will show you to your apartment," said the young hostess, as she arose, with a smile, to conduct her guest.
<p>They left the drawing-room together.
<p>And while Laura Lytton was arranging her toilet in the chamber above stairs, Emma Cavendish told her the particulars of Mary Grey's departure, and also of the letter she had received from her long-estranged relative, Mrs. Fanning.
<p>They went down to tea, where they were joined by Electra and the Rev. Dr. Jones.
<p>Miss Cavendish presented Mr. Lytton to Dr. Jones. And then they sat down to the table.
<p>Alden Lytton's eyes and thoughts were naturally enough occupied and interested in Emma Cavendish. He had not exactly fallen in love with her, but he was certainly filled with admiration for the loveliest girl he had ever seen. And he could but draw involuntary comparisons between the fair, frank, bright maiden and the beautiful, alluring widow.
<p>Both were brilliant, but with this difference: the one with the pure life-giving light of Heaven, and the other with the fatal fire of Tartarus.
<p>After tea they went into the drawing-room, where they spent a long evening talking over old times - their "old times" being something less than one year of age.
<p>And every hour confirmed Alden Lytton's admiration of Emma Cavendish.
<p>The next day Alden Lytton was invited upstairs to the old lady's room and presented to Madam Cavendish, who received him with much cordiality, telling him that his grandfather had been a lifelong personal friend of hers, and that she had known his father from his infancy up to the time that he had left the neighborhood to practice law in the city.
<p>And after a short interview the ancient gentlewoman and the young law student parted mutually well pleased with each other.
<p>"A fine young man - a very fine young man indeed; but more like his grandfather, as I remember him in his youth, than like his father, whom I could not always well approve," said the old lady to her confidential attendant, Aunt Moll, who had closed the chamber door after the departing visitor.
<p>"Dunno nuffin 'tall 'bout dat, ole mist'ess, but he monsus hansume, dough - umph-um; a'n't he dough? And a'n't he got eyes - umph-um!"
<p>Alden went down-stairs.
<p>"The most interesting old lady I have ever seen in my life, with the balsamic aroma of history and antiquity about her and all her surroundings," he said, as he joined the young ladies in the drawing-room.
<p>"Balsamic aroma of what?" inquired Electra, who had no taste for poetry and no reverence for antiquity. "Young man, it was the dried 'yarbs' she keeps in her closet that you smelled. Besides, antiquity has no other odor than that of mold and must."
<p>Alden blushed, laughed and looked at Emma Cavendish.
<p>"You must not mind my cousin Electra, Mr. Lytton. She is a privileged person among us. By the way, Laura has told you, I presume, of our relationship," said Emma, pleasantly.
<p>"Oh, yes!" returned young Lytton, with a smile and a bow. "And I am happy to have this opportunity of congratulating you both."
<p>"Thanks," said Miss Cavendish, with a vivid blush.
<p>"I believe there was some talk about a picnic party to the top of Porcupine Mountain, was there not?" inquired Electra, to cut short all sentiment.
<p>"Yes, my dear, and the horses are ordered for eleven o'clock. It is half-past ten now, and we will go and put on our hats and habits," replied Miss Cavendish, playfully rising and breaking up the conference.
<p>The party of young friends remained one week longer at Blue Cliffs, every day deepening and confirming the admiration and respect with which the beauty and the excellence of Emma Cavendish inspired Alden Lytton. But yet he was not in love with her.
<p>Every morning was spent by the young people in riding or driving about through the sublime and beautiful mountain and valley scenery of the neighborhood.
<p>And every evening was passed in fancy work, music, reading or conversation in the drawing-room.
<p>And so the pleasant days of the Easter holidays passed away, and the time for study and for work commenced.
<p>Laura and Electra went away from Blue Cliffs on the same day - Laura escorted by her brother Alden, and Electra by her grandfather, the Rev. Dr. Jones.
<p>As the party were assembled in the front hall to take leave of their fair young hostess before entering the large traveling carriage that was to take them to the Wendover railway station, Emma Cavendish went up to Alden Lytton and placed a letter in his hand, saying, with a frank smile:
<p>"As you are going direct to Charlottesville, Mr. Lytton, I will trouble you to take charge of this letter to our mutual friend, Mrs. Grey, who, you know, is now staying in that town. Will you do so?"
<p>"Certainly - with great pleasure," stammered Alden in extreme confusion, which he could scarcely conceal, and without the slightest consciousness that he was telling an enormous falsehood, but with full assurance that he should like to oblige Miss Cavendish.
<p>"I hope it will not inconvenience you to deliver this in person, Mr. Lytton," added Emma.
<p>"Certainly not, Miss Cavendish," replied Alden, telling unconscious fib the second.
<p>"For, you see, I am rather anxious about our friend. She left in ill health. She is almost a stranger in Charlottesville. And - this is the point - I have not heard from her, by letter or otherwise, since she left us; so I fear she may be too ill to write, and may have no friend near to write for her. This is why I tax your kindness to deliver the letter in person and find out how she is; and - write and let us know. I am asking a great deal of you, Mr. Lytton," added Emma, with a deprecating smile.
<p>"Not at all. It is a very small service that you require. And I hope you know that I should be exceedingly happy to have the opportunity of doing any very great service for you, Miss Cavendish," replied Alden, truthfully and earnestly.
<p>For in itself it was a very small service that Miss Cavendish had required of him, and he would have liked and even preferred another and a greater, and, in fact, a different service.
<p>"Many thanks," said Miss Cavendish, with a frank smile, as she left the letter in his hands.
<p>Then the adieus were all said, and promises of frequent correspondence and future visits exchanged among the young ladies. And the travelers departed, and the young hostess re-entered her lonely home and resumed her usual routine of domestic duties.
<p>She was anxious upon more than one account.
<p>More than a week had passed since the departure of Mary Grey, and yet, as she had told Alden Lytton, she had never heard even of her safe arrival at Charlottesville, and she feared that her protégée might be suffering from nervous illness among strangers.
<p>More than a week had also passed since she had telegraphed and written to her Aunt Fanning in New York. But no answer had yet come from that unhappy woman. And she feared that the poor relative whom she wished to succor might have met with some new misfortune.
<p>However, Emma had hoped, from day to day, that each morning's mail might bring her good news from Charlottesville or New York, or both.
<p>And even to-day she waited with impatience for the return of Jerome, who had driven the traveling-carriage containing the departing visitors to Wendover, and who might find letters for Blue Cliffs waiting at the post-office.
<p>Emma could not be at rest all that day, partly because she missed her young companions, whose society had made the lonely house so cheerful, and partly because she half expected news with the return of Jerome.
<p>She wandered up and down the deserted drawing-room, and then went upstairs to the chambers just vacated by her young friends, where she found Sarah, the chamber-maid, engaged in dismantling beds and dressing-tables preparatory to shutting up the "spare rooms" for the rest of the season.
<p>All this was very dreary and dispiriting.
<p>She left these apartments and would have gone into the old lady's room, only that she knew her grandmother was at this hour taking the first of her two daily naps.
<p>As she turned to go down-stairs she glanced through the front hall window and caught a glimpse of the traveling-carriage, with Jerome perched upon the box, slowly winding its way around the circular avenue that led to the house.
<p>She ran down-stairs briskly enough now, and ran out of the front door.
<p>"Any letters to-day, Jerome?" she inquired.
<p>"No, miss," answered Jerome, shaking his head.
<p>"Oh, dear, how depressing!" sighed Emma, as she turned to go into the house.
<p>But a sound arrested her steps - the opening of the carriage-door. She turned and saw Jerome standing before it and in the act of helping some one to alight from the carriage.
<p>Another moment and a tall, thin, dark-eyed woman, with very white hair, and clad in the deepest widow's weeds, stood before Miss Cavendish.
<p>As for Jerome, he stood wickedly enjoying his young lady's astonishment, and looking as if he himself had performed a very meritorious action.
<p>"Miss Emma Cavendish, I presume?" said the stranger, a little hesitatingly.
<p>"Yes, madam. And you are my Aunt Fanning, I am sure. And I am very glad to see you," answered Emma Cavendish.
<p>And she put her arms around the stranger's neck and kissed her.
<p>"Dat's better'n letters, a'n't it, Miss Emmer?" inquired Jerome, grinning from ear to ear, and showing a double row of the strongest and whitest ivories, as he proceeded to take from the carriage various packages, boxes and traveling-bags and so forth.
<p>"Yes, better than letters, Jerome. Follow us into the house with that luggage. Come, dear aunt, let us go in. Lean on my arm. Don't be afraid to lean heavily. I am very strong," said Emma; and drawing the poor lady's emaciated hand through her own arm she led her into the house.
<p>She took her first into the family sitting-room, where there was a cheerful fire burning, which the chilly mountain air, in this spring weather, made very acceptable.
<p>She placed her in a comfortable cushioned rocking-chair and proceeded to take off the traveling-bonnet and shawl with her own hands, saying:
<p>"You must get well rested and refreshed here before you go up to your room. You look very tired."
<p>"I am very weak, my dear," answered the lady, in a faint voice.
<p>"I see that you are. I am very sorry to see you so feeble; but we will make you stronger here in our exhilarating mountain air. If I had known that you would come by this train I should have gone to the railway station in person to meet you," said Emma, kindly.
<p>Mrs. Fanning turned her great black eyes upon the young lady and stared at her in surprise.
<p>"Why, did you not get my letter?" she inquired.
<p>"No," said Emma. "I anxiously expected to hear from you from day to day, but heard nothing either by letter or telegram."
<p>"That is strange! I wrote to you three days ago that I should be at Wendover this morning, and so, when I found your carriage there, I thought that you had sent for me."
<p>"It was very fortunate that the carriage was there, and I am very glad of it; but it was not in fact sent to meet you, for, not having received your letter, I did not know that you would arrive to-day. The carriage was sent to take some visitors who had been staying with us, and were going away, to the railway station. It is a wonder Jerome had not explained this to you. He is so talkative," said Emma, smiling.
<p>"I never talk to strange servants," gravely replied the lady. "But I will tell you how it happened. I really arrived by the earliest train, that got in at Wendover at five o'clock in the morning. There was no carriage from Blue Cliffs waiting for me at the railway station, and, in fact, no carriage from any place, except the hack from the Reindeer Hotel. So I got into that, and, having previously left word with the station-master to send the Blue Cliffs carriage after me to the Reindeer when it should come, I went on to the hotel to get breakfast and to lie down and rest. But when half the forenoon had passed away without any arrival for me, I began to grow anxious, fearing that some mistake had been made."
<p>"I am very sorry you had to suffer this annoyance, immediately upon your arrival here too," said Emma, regretfully.
<p>"Oh, it did not last long! About noon the landlord, Greenfield, rapped at my door and told me that the Blue Cliffs carriage had come, and that the ostler was watering the horses while the coachman was taking a glass of beer at the bar."
<p>"Jerome had doubtless taken our visitors to the station, and called at the Reindeer to refresh himself and his horses."
<p>"Yes, I suppose so. Almost at the same moment that the landlord came to my door to announce the carriage, I heard some one else, under my window, saying to the coachman that there was a lady here waiting to be taken to Blue Cliffs; and I went down and got into the carriage with bag and baggage. Jerome, if that's his name, very gravely, with a silent bow, put up the steps and closed the door and mounted his box and drove off."
<p>"But you must have left some baggage behind."
<p>"Yes, three trunks; one very large. Mr. Greenfield, of the Reindeer, promised to send them right after me in his wagon."
<p>While they had been speaking, Emma Cavendish had touched the bell and given a whispered order to the servant who answered it.
<p>So now the second footman, Peter, appeared with a waiter in his hands, on which was served tea, toast, a broiled squab and glass of currant jelly.
<p>This was set upon a stand beside Mrs. Fanning's easy-chair.
<p>"I think that you had better take something before you go upstairs," said the young hostess, kindly, as she poured out a cup of tea.
<p>Consumptives are almost always hungry and thirsty, as if nature purposely created an unusual appetite for nourishment in order to supply the excessive waste of tissue caused by the malady.
<p>And so Mrs. Fanning really enjoyed the delicate luncheon set before her so much that she finished the squab, the jelly, the toast and the tea.
<p>When she had been offered and had refused a second supply, Emma proposed that she should go up to her room, and she took her at once to the beautiful corner chamber, with its southern and eastern aspect, that had been fitted up for her.
<p>Here she found that her traveling-trunks, which had already arrived from Wendover, were placed.
<p>And here, when she had changed her traveling-dress for a loose wrapper, she laid down on a lounge to rest, while Emma darkened the room and left her to repose.
<p>Miss Cavendish went straight to the old lady's apartment.
<p>Mrs. Cavendish was sitting in her great easy-chair by the fire, with her gold-rimmed spectacles on her nose and her Bible lying open on her lap.
<p>As Emma entered the room the old lady closed the book and looked up with a welcoming smile.
<p>"I have come to tell you, my dear grandma, that Aunt Fanning has arrived," said Emma, drawing a chair and seating herself by the old lady's side.
<p>"Yes, my dear child; but I'll trouble you not to call her Aunt Fanning," said Madam Cavendish, haughtily.
<p>"But she is my aunt, dear grandma," returned Emma, with a deprecating smile.
<p>"Then call her Aunt Katherine. I detest the name of that tavern-keeper whom she married."
<p>"Grandma - grandma, the man has gone where at least there can be no distinctions of mere family rank," said Emma.
<p>"That's got nothing to do with it. We are here now. Well, and when did Katherine arrive, and where have you put her? Tell me all about it."
<p>Emma told her all about it.
<p>"Well," said the old lady, "as she is here, though sorely against my approbation - still, as she is here we must give her a becoming welcome, I suppose. You may bring her to my room to-morrow morning."
<p>"Thank you, grandma, dear; that is just what I would like to do," replied the young lady.
<p>Accordingly, the next morning Mrs. Fanning was conducted by Emma to the "Throne Room," as Electra had saucily designated the old lady's apartment.
<p>Madam Cavendish was dressed with great care, in a fine black cashmere wrapper, lined and trimmed with black silk, and a fine white lace cap, trimmed with white piping.
<p>And old Moll, also in her best clothes, stood behind her mistress's chair.
<p>The old lady meant to impress "the tavern-keeper's widow" with a due sense of reverence.
<p>But the gentlewoman's heart was a great deal better than her head. And so, when she saw the girl whom she had once known a brilliant, rich-complexioned brunette, with raven hair and sparkling eyes and queenly form changed into a woman, old before her time, pale, thin, gray and sorrow-stricken, her heart melted with pity, and she held out her hand, saying, kindly:
<p>"How do you do, Katie, my dear? I am very sorry to see you looking in such ill-health. You have changed very much from the child I knew you, twenty-five years ago."
<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Fanning, as she took and pressed the venerable hand that was held out to her. "I have changed. But there is only one more change that awaits me - the last great one."
<p>"Moll, wheel forward that other easy-chair. Sit down at once, my poor Katie. You look ready to drop from weakness. Emma, my child, pour out a glass of that old port wine and bring it to your aunt. You will find it in that little cabinet," said Madam Cavendish, speaking to one and another in her hurry to be hospitable and to atone for the hard thoughts she had cherished and expressed toward this poor suffering and desolate woman.
<p>And Mrs. Fanning was soon seated in the deep, soft "sleepy hollow," and sipping with comfort the rich old port wine.
<p>"Yes, Katie," said the old lady, resuming the thread of the conversation, "that last great change awaits us all - a glorious change, Katie, that I for one look forward to with satisfaction and desire always - with rapture and longing sometimes. What will the next life be like, I wonder? We don't know. 'Eye hath not seen - ear heard,'" mused the old lady.
<p>The interview was not a long one. Soon Emma Cavendish took her aunt from the room.
<p>"You must come in and see me every day, Katie, my dear," said the old lady, as the two visitors left.
<p>And from that time the desolate widow, the homeless wanderer, found loving and tender friends, and a comfortable and quiet home.
<p>Meanwhile the visitors that had left Blue Cliffs that morning traveled together until they reached Richmond.
<p>The train got in at ten o'clock that night.
<p>There was no steamboat to Mount Ascension Island until the next day.
<p>So the party for that bourne were compelled to spend the night at Richmond.
<p>Alden, although he might have gone on to Charlottesville that night, determined to remain with his friends.
<p>The whole party went to the Henrico House, where they were accommodated with adjoining rooms.
<p>The next morning they resumed their journey, separating to go their several ways. Alden saw the two young ladies safely on the steamboat that was to take them to Mount Ascension, and then bade them good-bye, leaving them in charge of the Rev. Dr. Jones, who was to escort them to the end of their journey.
<p>He had barely time to secure his seat for Charlottesville, where he arrived on the afternoon of the same day.
<p>The letter he had to deliver to Mary Grey "burned in his pocket." He could not have done otherwise than promise to deliver it in person, when fair Emma Cavendish had requested him to do so. And now, of course, he must keep his word and go and carry the letter to her, although he would rather have walked into a fire than into that false siren's presence.
<p>It is true that his love for her was dead and gone. But it had died such a cruel and violent death that the very memory of it was full of pain and horror, and to meet her would be like meeting the specter of his murdered love. Nevertheless he must not shrink from his duty; he must go and do it.
<p>Before reporting at his college, he went to a hotel and changed his clothes, and then started out to find Mary Grey's residence. That was not so easily done. She had omitted to leave her address with her friends at Blue Cliffs, and Emma's letter was simply directed to Mrs. Mary Grey, Charlottesville.
<p>True, Charlottesville was not a very large place; but looking for a lady there was something like looking for the fabulous needle in the haystack.
<p>Still, he had formed a plan of action to find her. He knew that she pretended to great piety; that she was a member of the Protestant Episcopal Church, and that wherever she might happen to sojourn she would be sure to join the church and make friends with the clergy of her own denomination.
<p>So Alden bent his steps to the house of the Episcopal minister at Charlottesville.
<p>He found the reverend gentleman at home, and received from him, as he had expected to do, the address of Mrs. Grey.
<p>"A most excellent young woman, sir - an earnest Christian. She lost not a day in presenting her church letter and uniting herself with the church. She has been here but ten days, and already she has taken a class in the Sunday-school. A most meritorious young woman, sir," said the worthy minister, as he handed the card with Mrs. Grey's new address written upon it.
<p>To Alden, who knew the false-hearted beauty so well, all this was surprising.
<p>But he made no comment. He simply took the card, bowed his thanks, and left the house to go and seek the home of Mrs. Grey.
<p>Among many falsehoods, the woman had told one truth when she had informed Emma Cavendish that she had a lady friend at Charlottesville who kept a students' boarding-house. She had met this lady just previous to engaging as drawing-mistress at Mount Ascension. And by her alluring arts she had won her sympathy and confidence. She was staying with this friend at the time that Alden sought her out.
<p>He now easily found the house.
<p>And when he inquired of the negro boy who answered the bell whether Mrs. Grey was at home, he was answered in the affirmative and invited to enter the house.
<p>The boy opened a door on the right hand of the narrow entrance passage, and Alden passed into the parlor and found himself, unannounced, in the presence of his false love.
<p>There was no one with her, and she was sitting at a table, with drawing materials before her, apparently engaged in copying a picture.
<p>Hearing the door open and shut, she lifted her head and looked up.
<p>Seeing Alden Lytton standing before her, she dropped the pencil from her fingers, turned deathly pale and stared at him in silence.
<p>Alden, if the truth must be told, was scarcely less agitated; but he soon recovered his self-command.
<p>"I should apologize," he said, "for coming in unannounced; but I did not know that you were here. I was shown into this room by the waiter, supposing that I was to remain here until he took my card to you."
<p>She neither moved nor spoke, but sat and stared at him.
<p>"I have only come as the bearer of a letter to you from Miss Cavendish - a letter that I promised to deliver in person. Here it is," he said, laying the little packet on the table before her.
<p>Still she made no answer to his words, nor any acknowledgment of his service. She did not even take up Emma's letter.
<p>"And now, having done my errand, I will bid you good-afternoon, Mrs. Grey," he said, bowing and turning to leave the room.
<p>That broke the panic-stricken spell that held her still.
<p>She started up and clasped her hands suddenly together, exclaiming:
<p>"No, no, no; for pity's sake don't go yet! Now that you are here, for Heaven's sake stay a moment and listen to me!"
<p>"What can you possibly have to say to me, Mrs. Grey?" coolly inquired the young man.
<p>"Oh, sit down - sit down one little moment and hear me! I have not got the plague, that you should hasten from me so," she pleaded.
<p>It was in Alden's thoughts to say that moral plagues were even more dangerous and fatal than material ones; but the woman before him looked so really distressed that he forbore.
<p>"I know that you have ceased to love me," she went on in a broken voice. "I know, of course, that you have ceased to love me - "
<p>"Yes, I am thoroughly cured of that egregious boyish folly," assented Alden, grimly.
<p>"I know it, and I would not seek to recover your lost, lost love; but - "
<p>Her voice, that had been faltering, now quite broke down, and she burst into tears and sobbed as if her heart was breaking.
<p>And her grief was as real as it was violent; for she had loved the handsome young law student, and she mourned the loss of his love.
<p>Alden sat apparently unmoved, but in truth he was beginning to feel very sorry for this woman, but it was with the sorrow we feel for a suffering criminal, and totally distinct from sympathy or affection.
<p>Presently her gust of tears and sobs exhausted itself, and she sighed and dried her eyes and said:
<p>"Yes, I know that all love is quite over between us."
<p>"Quite over," assented Alden, emphatically.
<p>"And it is not to renew that subject that I asked you to stay and listen to me."
<p>"No," said Alden, gently, "I presume not."
<p>"But, though all thoughts of love are forever over between us, yet I can not bear that we should live at enmity. As for me, I am not your enemy, Alden Lytton."
<p>"Nor am I yours, Mrs. Grey. You and I can live as strangers without being enemies."
<p>"Live as strangers! Oh, but that is just what would break my heart utterly! Why should we live as strangers? If all love is over between us, and if we are still not enemies, if we have forgiven each other, why should we two live as strangers in this little town? Why may we not meet at least as the common friends of every day?"
<p>"Because the memory of the past would preclude the possibility of our meeting pleasantly or profitably."
<p>"Oh, Alden, you are very hard! You have not forgiven me!"
<p>"I have utterly forgiven you."
<p>"But you cherish hard thoughts of me?"
<p>"Mrs. Grey, I must regard your actions - the actions that separated us - as they really are," answered Alden, sadly and firmly, as he arose and took his hat to leave the room.
<p>"No, no, no; don't go yet! You must hear me - you shall hear me! Even a convicted murderer is allowed to speak for himself!" she exclaimed, with passionate tears.
<p>Alden sighed and sat down.
<p>"You must regard my actions as they really are, you say. Ah, but the extenuating circumstances, the temptations, the motives - aye, the motives! - have you ever thought of them?"
<p>"I can see no motive that could justify your acts," said Alden, coldly.
<p>"No, not justify - I do not justify them even to myself - not justify, but palliate them, Alden - palliate them at least in your eyes, if in no others."
<p>"And why in my eyes, Mrs. Grey?"
<p>"Oh, Alden, all was planned for your sake!"
<p>"For my sake? I pray you do not say that!"
<p>"Listen, then, and consider all the circumstances. I loved you and promised to be your wife at that far distant day when you should come into a living law practice. But I was homeless, penniless and helpless. I had lost my situation in the school, and I had no prospect of getting another. The term of my visit to Emma Cavendish had nearly expired and I had nowhere to go. Governor Cavendish loved me with the idolatrous love of an old man for a young woman, and besought me to be his wife with such insane earnestness that I thought my refusal would certainly be his death, especially as it was well known that he was liable to apoplexy and that any excitement might bring on a fatal attack. Under all these circumstances I think I must have lost my senses; for I reasoned with myself - most falsely and fatally reasoned with myself thus: Why should not I, who am about to be cast out homeless and penniless upon the wide world - why should not I secure myself a home and save this old man's life for a few years longer by accepting his love and becoming his wife? It is true that I do not love him, but I honor him very much. And I would be the comfort of his declining years. He could not live long, and when he should come to die I should inherit the widow's third of all his vast estates. And then, after a year of mourning should be over, I could marry my true love, and bring him a fortune too. There, Alden, the reasoning was all false, wicked and fatal. I know that now. But oh, Alden, it was not so much for myself as for others that I planned thus! I thought to have blessed and comforted the old man's declining years, and after his death to have brought a fortune to you. These were my motives. They do not justify, but at least they palliate my conduct."
<p>She ceased.
<p>Alden did not reply, but stood up again with his hat in his hand.
<p>"And now, Alden, though we may never be lovers again, may we not meet sometimes as friends? I am so lonely here! I am, indeed, all alone in the world. We may meet sometimes as friends, Alden?" she asked, pathetically.
<p>"No, Mrs. Grey. But yet, if ever I can serve you in any way I will do so most willingly. Good-afternoon," said the young man.
<p>And he bowed and left the room.
<p>As he disappeared her beautiful face darkened with a baleful cloud. "No fury like a woman scorned," wrote one who seemed to know. Her face darkened like a thunder-storm, and from its cloud her eyes shot forked lightning. She set her teeth, and clinched her little fist and shook it after him, hissing:
<p>"He scorns me - he scorns me! Ah, he may scorn my love! Let him beware of my hate! He will not meet me as a friend, but he will serve me willingly! Very well; he shall be often called upon to serve me, if only to bring him under my power!"
<p>Mary Grey now set systematically to work. Partly from love or its base counterfeit, partly from hate, but mostly from vanity, she determined to devote every faculty of mind and body to one set object - to win Alden Lytton's love back again and to subjugate him to her will.
<p>To all outward seeming she led a most blameless and beneficent life.
<p>She lived with the bishop's widow, and made herself very useful and agreeable to the staid lady, who refused to take any money for her board.
<p>And although the house was full of students, who boarded and lodged and spent their evenings there, with the most wonderful self-government she forebore "to make eyes" at any of them.
<p>She now no longer said in so many words that "her heart was buried in the grave," and so forth; but she quietly acted as if it was.
<p>She put away all her mourning finery - her black tulles and silks and bugles and jet jewelry - and she took to wearing the plainest black alpacas and the plainest white muslin caps. She looked more like a Protestant nun than a "sparkling" young widow. But she looked prettier and more interesting than ever, and she knew it.
<p>She was a regular attendant at her church, going twice on Sunday and twice during the week.
<p>On Sunday mornings she was always sure of finding Alden Lytton in his seat, which was in full sight of her own. But she never looked toward him. She was content to feel that he often looked at her, and that he could not look at her and remain quite indifferent to her.
<p>She was also an active member of all the parish benevolent societies, a zealous teacher in the Sunday-school, an industrious seamstress in the sewing-circle, and a regular visitor of the poor and sick.
<p>Her life seemed devoted to good works, apparently from the love of the Lord and the love of her neighbor.
<p>She won golden opinions from all sorts of men, and women too. Only there was one significant circumstance about her popularity - she could not win the love of children. No, not with all her beauty and grace of person, and sweetness and softness of tone and manner, she could not win the children. Their sensitive spirits shrank from the evil within her which the duller souls of adults could not even perceive. And many an innocent child was sent in disgrace from the parlor because it either would not kiss "sweet Mrs. Grey" at all, or would kiss her with the air of taking a dose of physic.
<p>But all the people in Charlottesville praised the piety and, above all, the prudence of Mrs. Grey - "Such a young and beautiful woman to be so entirely weaned from worldliness and self-love and so absorbed in worship and good works!"
<p>All this certainly produced an effect upon Alden Lytton, who, of course, heard her praises on all sides, who saw her every Sunday at church, and who met her occasionally at the demure little tea-parties to which both might happen to be invited.
<p>When they met thus by chance in private houses he would bow and say, quietly:
<p>"Good-evening, madam;" a salutation which she would return by a grave:
<p>"Good-evening, sir."
<p>And not another word would pass between them during the evening.
<p>But all the young man observed in her at such times was a certain discreet reserve, which he could but approve.
<p>"She seems to be much changed. She seems to be truly grieved for the past. Perhaps I have judged her too harshly. And yet what a base part that was she proposed to play! may be that she herself did not know how base it was. Such ignorance would prove an appalling moral blindness. But then, again, should she be held responsible for her moral blindness? It sometimes requires suffering to teach the nature of sin. A child does not know that fire is dangerous until it burns itself. Her suffering must have opened her eyes to the 'exceeding sinfulness of sin.' For her own sake I hope it is so. As for myself, it does not matter. I have ceased to regard her with any other feeling than pity and charity. And although she would become a saint I could never love her again," he said to himself one night, after passing an evening with her at one of the professor's houses.
<p>And his thoughts reverted to that lovely maiden whose golden hair formed an appropriate halo around her white brow, and whose pure soul looked frankly forth from her clear blue eyes.
<p>He was not in love with Miss Cavendish, he said to himself, but he could not help feeling the difference between radiant frankness and dark deceit.
<p>One evening, about this time, they met at a strawberry festival, held in the lecture-room of the church, for the benefit of the Sunday-school.
<p>While the festival was at its height a thunder-storm came up, with a heavy shower of rain. But the company at the festival cared little about that. They were housed, and enjoyed themselves with light music, fruits, flowers and friends. And before the hour of separation the storm would probably be over, and carriages, or at least water-proof cloaks, overshoes and umbrella's, would be in attendance upon every one.
<p>So they made merry until eleven o'clock, when the storm was passing away with a steady light rain.
<p>Every lady who had a carriage in waiting offered to give Mrs. Grey a seat and to set her down at her own door.
<p>Mary Grey thanked each in succession and declined the kind offer, adding that she expected some one to come for her.
<p>At last nearly everybody had left the room but the treasurer of the festival, who was counting the receipts, and the sexton, who was covering the tables, preparatory to closing for the night.
<p>Alden Lytton had lingered to make a quiet donation to the charity, and he was passing out, when, he saw Mary Grey standing shivering near the door.
<p>As he came up to her she stepped out into the darkness and the rain.
<p>He hastened after her, exclaiming:
<p>"Mrs. Grey! I beg your pardon! Are you alone?"
<p>"Yes, Mr. Lytton," she answered, quietly.
<p>"And you have no umbrella!" he said, quickly, as he hoisted his own and stepped to her side. "Permit me to see you safe to your door. Take my arm. It is very dark and the walking is dangerous. The sidewalks are turned to brooks by this storm," he added, as he held his umbrella carefully over her.
<p>"I thank you very much, Mr. Lytton; but indeed I do not wish to give you so much trouble. I can go home quite well enough alone. I have often to do it," she answered, shrinking away from him.
<p>"It is not safe for you to do so, especially on such a night as this. Will you take my arm?" he said; and, without waiting for her answer, he took her hand and drew it through his arm and walked on with her in silence, wondering at and blaming the heartlessness of the ladies of her circle who had carriages in attendance, and had, as he supposed, every one of them, gone off without offering this poor lonely creature a seat, leaving her to get home through the night and storm as she could.
<p>As they walked on he felt Mary Grey's arm trembling upon his own, and involuntarily he drew it closer, and, in so doing, he perceived the tremor and jar of her fast-beating heart, and he pitied her with a deep, tender, manly pity.
<p>"I am afraid you feel chilled in this rain," he said, by way of saying something kind.
<p>"No," she answered, softly, and said no more.
<p>They got to the door of her dwelling, and he rang the bell and waited there with her until some one should come.
<p>"I am very much indebted to you, Mr. Lytton," she said, softly and coolly; "but I am also very sorry to have given you so much trouble."
<p>"I assure you it was no trouble; and I beg that you will not again attempt to go alone at night through the streets of Charlottesville," he answered, sadly.
<p>"But why?" she asked. "What harm or danger can there be in my doing so?"
<p>"Ladies never go out alone at night here. Many of the wild students are on the streets at night and are not always in their senses."
<p>"Oh, I see! Well, I will try to take care of myself. I hear the page coming to open the door. Good-night, Mr. Lytton. You have been very kind. I thank you very much," said Mrs. Grey, coldly.
<p>He touched his hat and turned away just as the door was opened.
<p>Alden Lytton went back to the college with somewhat kinder thoughts of Mary Grey.
<p>And Mrs. Grey went into the house and into the back parlor, where the bishop's widow was waiting up for her.
<p>"Why, my dear, your shoes are wet through and your skirts are draggled up to your knees! Is it possible you walked home through the rain?" inquired the lady.
<p>"Yes, madam; but it will not hurt me."
<p>"But how came you to walk home when Mrs. Doctor Sage promised faithfully to bring you home in her carriage?"
<p>"Oh, my dear friend, the storm came up, and so many people were afraid of wetting their feet that I gave up my seat to another lady," answered Mary Grey.
<p>"Always the same self-sacrificing spirit! Well, my dear, I hope your reward will come in the next world, if not in this. Now go upstairs and take off your wet clothes and get right to bed. I will send you up a glass of hot spiced wine, which will prevent you from taking cold," said the hospitable old lady.
<p>Mary Grey kissed her hostess, said good-night, and ran away upstairs to her own cozy room, where, although it was May time, a bright little wood fire was burning in the fire-place to correct the dampness of the air.
<p>"Well," she said, with her silent laugh, as she began to take off her sodden shoes, "it was worth the wetting to walk home with Alden Lytton, and to make one step of progress toward my object."
<p>And the thought comforted her more than did the silver mug of hot spiced wine that the little page presently brought her.
<p>A few days after this she met Alden Lytton again, by accident, at the house of a mutual friend. Alden came up to her and, after the usual greeting, said:
<p>"I have received a short note from Miss Cavendish inquiring of me whether I had delivered her letter to you, and saying that she had received no answer from you, and indeed no news of you since your departure from Blue Cliffs. Now if I had not supposed that you would have answered Miss Emma's letter immediately I should certainly have written myself to relieve her anxiety on your account."
<p>"Oh, indeed I beg her pardon and yours! But I have sprained the fore-finger of my right hand and can not write at all. Otherwise I am quite well. Pray write and explain this to Emma, with my love, and my promise to write to her as soon as my finger gets well," said Mary Grey.
<p>And then she arose to take leave of her hostess, and, with a distant bow to Alden Lytton, she left the house.
<p>Two days after this she received a very kind letter from Miss Cavendish expressing much regret to hear of her disabled hand, and affectionately inquiring of her when she should return to Blue Cliffs, adding that Mrs. Fanning had arrived, and was then domiciled at the house; and, though a widow and an invalid, she was a very agreeable companion.
<p>This letter also inclosed a check for the amount of the quarterly allowance Emma Cavendish wasted upon Mary Grey.
<p>"For whether you abandon us or not, dear Mrs. Grey, or wherever you may be, so long as I can reach you I will send you this quarterly sum, which I consider yours of right," she wrote. And with more expressions of kindness and affection the letter closed.
<p>This letter was a great relief to Mary Grey's anxiety; for now that this worshiper of mammon was sure of her income she had no fears for the future.
<p>But she dared not herself answer the letter. While Mrs. Fanning should remain at Blue Cliffs, Mary Grey must not let her handwriting go there, lest it should be seen and recognized by Frederick Fanning's widow.
<p>But the next day was Sunday, and Mrs. Grey went to church, taking Emma's letter in her pocket.
<p>Usually she avoided Alden Lytton on these occasions, refraining even from looking toward him during the church service or afterward, for she did not wish him to suppose that she sought his notice.
<p>But now she had a fair and good excuse for speaking to him; so when the service was over and the congregation was leaving the church she waited at the door of her pew until Alden passed by, when she said, very meekly and coolly:
<p>"Mr. Lytton, may I speak with you a moment?"
<p>"Certainly, madam," said Alden, stopping at once.
<p>"I have a letter from dearest Emma, but I can not answer it. Ah, my poor crippled finger! Would you be so very kind as to write and tell my darling that I have received it and how much I thank her? And here; perhaps, as you are to acknowledge the letter for me, you had better read it. There is really nothing in it that a mutual friend may not see," she said, drawing the letter from her pocket and putting it into his hand.
<p>"Certainly, madam, if you wish me to do so; certainly, with much pleasure," answered Alden Lytton, with more warmth than he had intended; because, in truth, he was beginning to feel delight in every subject that concerned Emma Cavendish, and he was now especially pleased with having the privilege of reading her letter and the duty of acknowledging it.
<p>"Many thanks! You are very kind! Good-morning," said Mary Grey, with discreet coolness, as she passed on before him to leave the church.
<p>"Step number two! I shall soon have him in my power again!" chuckled the coquette, as she walked down the street toward her dwelling.
<p>For Mary Grey had utterly misinterpreted the warmth of Alden Lytton's manner in acceding to her request. It never entered her mind to think that this warmth had anything to do with the idea of Emma Cavendish. She was much too vain to be jealous.
<p>She did not really think that there was a man in the world who could withstand her charms, or a woman in the world who could become her rival.
<p>And certainly her personal experience went far to confirm her in that vain theory. Therefore she did not fear Emma Cavendish as a rival.
<p>And while she did not dare to write to Blue Cliffs, she did not hesitate to make Alden Lytton the medium of communication with Emma Cavendish.
<p>Her other lover, the counterpart of Alden Lytton, had not appeared since he had called on her on his first visit to Charlottesville.
<p>But he wrote to her six times a week, and she knew what he was doing - he was trying hard to settle up his business at Wendover, with the distant hope of removing to Charlottesville and opening a store there.
<p>Affairs went on in this way for one year longer. Emma Cavendish continued to write regularly to Mrs. Grey, telling her all the little household and neighborhood news. Among the rest, she told her how Mrs. Fanning, by her gentleness and patience, was winning the affections of all her household, and especially of Madam Cavendish, who had been most of all prejudiced against her; and how much the invalid's health was improving.
<p>"She will never be perfectly well again; but I think, with proper care, and under Divine Providence, we may succeed in preserving her life for many years longer."
<p>Now, as Mary Grey could not venture to return to Blue Cliffs, or even to write a letter to that place with her own hand, so long as Mrs. Fanning should live in the house, the prospect of her doing either grew more and more remote.
<p>She could not plead her sprained finger forever as an excuse for not writing; so one day she put on a very tight glove and buttoned it over her wrist, and then took a harder steel pen than she had ever used before, and she sat down and wrote a few lines by way of experiment. It was perfectly successful. Between the tight-fitting glove and the hard steel pen her handwriting was so disguised that she herself would never have known it, nor could any expert ever have detected it. So there was no possible danger of any one at Blue Cliffs recognizing it as hers.
<p>Then, with this tightly-gloved hand and this hard steel pen, she sat down and wrote a letter to Emma Cavendish, saying that she could no longer deny herself the pleasure of writing to her darling, though her finger was still so stiff that she wrote with great difficulty, as might be seen in the cramped and awkward letters, "all looking as if they had epileptic fits," she jestingly added.
<p>When Miss Cavendish replied to this letter she said that indeed Mrs. Grey's hand must have been very severely sprained, and that she herself would never have known the writing.
<p>After this all Mrs. Grey's letters to Miss Cavendish were written by a hand buttoned up in a tight glove, and with a hard steel pen, and continued to be stiff and unrecognizable.
<p>And in all Emma's answers there was surprise and regret expressed for the long-continued lameness of Mary Grey's right hand.
<p>One day Emma communicated a piece of neighborhood gossip that quite startled Mary Grey.
<p>"You will be sorry to hear," she wrote, "that our excellent pastor, Dr. Goodwin, has had a paralytic stroke that disables him from preaching. The Rev. Mr. Lyle, formerly of Richmond, is filling the pulpit."
<p>Mary Grey was very much interested in this piece of news, that her own old admirer should be even temporarily located so near Blue Cliffs, with the possibility of his being permanently settled there.
<p>She had not heard from this devoted clerical lover once since she had left Mount Ascension. She did not understand his sudden withdrawal, and she had often, with much mental disquietude, associated his unexpected estrangement with her own unceremonious dismissal from her situation as drawing-mistress at that academy.
<p>It is true that when they corresponded, in answer to his ardent love-letters, she would write only such kind and friendly notes that could never have compromised her in any way, even if they should have been read in open court or published in a Sunday newspaper.
<p>And he had sometimes complained of the formal friendliness of these letters from one for whom he had truly professed the most devoted love, and who had also promised to be his wife - if ever she was anybody's.
<p>But Mrs. Grey had artfully soothed his wounded affection without departing from her prudential system of writing only such letters as she would not fear to have fall in the hands of any living creature, until suddenly he ceased to write at all.
<p>At the time of this defection she had been too much taken up with her purpose of winning the affection of the wealthy and distinguished statesman, Governor Cavendish, to pay much attention to the fact of the Rev. Mr. Lyle's falling away.
<p>But in these later and calmer days at Blue Cliffs and at Charlottesville she had pondered much on the circumstance in connection with her simultaneous dismissal from her situation at Mount Ascension; and she thought all but too likely that Mr. Lyle had, like Mrs. St. John, learned something of her past life so much to her disadvantage as to induce him to abandon her.
<p>And now to have him so near Blue Cliffs as Wendover parish church seemed dangerous to Mary Grey's interests with the Cavendish family.
<p>Sometimes the unhappy woman seemed to think that the net of Fate was drawing around her. Mrs. Fanning was at Blue Cliffs. Mr. Lyle was at Wendover. What next?
<p>Why, next she got a letter from Emma Cavendish that struck all the color from her cheeks and all the courage from her soul.
<p>Miss Cavendish, after telling the domestic and social news of the week, and adding that the Rev. Mr. Lyle was now settled permanently at Wendover, as the assistant of the Rev. Dr. Goodwin, whose health continued to be infirm, wrote:
<p>"And now, dearest Mrs. Grey, I have reserved the best news for the last.
<p>"Laura Lytton and Electra have left school 'for good.' They will arrive here this evening on a visit of some months.
<p>"Next week we are all going to Charlottesville, to be present at the Commencement of the Law College, when Mr. Alden Lytton expects to take his degree.
<p>"Aunt Fanning, whose health is much improved, will accompany us as our chaperon, and the Rev. Mr. Lyle will escort us.
<p>"So you see, my dear Mrs. Grey, though you will not come to us, we will go to you.
<p>"But we will form quite a large party. And I know that Charlottesville will receive an inundation of visitors for the Commencement, and that there will be a pressure upon all the hotels and boarding-houses. Therefore I will ask you to be so good as to seek out and engage apartments for us. There will be four ladies and one gentleman to be accommodated; we shall want at least three rooms - one for Mr. Lyle, one for Aunt Fanning and myself, and one for Laura and Electra. We want our rooms all in the same house, if possible; if not, then Mr. Lyle can be accommodated apart from the set; but we women must remain together.
<p>"Please see to it at once, and write and let me know.
<p>"By the way: after Mr. Lytton takes his degree he will make us a short visit at Blue Cliffs, after which he will go to Richmond to commence the practice of law, where he thinks the prestige of his father's name, and I think his own talents, will speedily advance him to fame and fortune.
<p>"But what am I telling you? That of which you probably know much more than I do; for of course Mr. Lytton must have informed you of his plans.
<p>"We confidently hope to persuade you to accompany us when we go back to Blue Cliffs. Our summer party will be such a very pleasant one: there will be Laura, Electra, Mrs. Grey and Aunt Fanning among the ladies, and Mr. Lyle, Mr. Lytton and Dr. Jones among the gentlemen. I shall have your rooms made ready for you."
<p>There was much more of kind and affectionate planning for the summer's work and pleasure. But Mary Grey read no further. Dropping the letter upon her lap, she clasped her hands and raised her pale face toward heaven, murmuring:
<p>"She is coming here. I dare not meet her. I must go away again. I am hunted to death - I am hunted to death! I was hunted from Blue Cliffs, and now I am hunted from Charlottesville! Where shall I go next? To Richmond? Yes, of course, to Richmond! And there I will stay. For there is room to hide myself from any one whom I do not wish to see. And in a few weeks he will go to Richmond to settle there permanently. But I will go some few weeks in advance of him, so that he will never be able to say that I followed him there!"
<p>Having formed this resolution, Mary Grey then set about, immediately to engage lodgings for the Blue Cliffs party.
<p>She knew that her hostess, the bishop's widow, had one vacant room: that would accommodate two of the ladies, and therefore she resolved to make a virtue of her own necessities and give up her own room for the accommodation of the other two.
<p>She proposed this plan to her hostess, who at first opposed the self-sacrifice, as she called it. But finally, being persuaded by Mary Grey, she yielded the point, and fervently praised the beautiful, unselfish spirit of her young guest, who was ever so ready to sacrifice her own comfort for the convenience of others.
<p>Mary Grey then wrote to Miss Cavendish, telling her of the arrangement, and then explaining:
<p>"You must know, my dear girl, that my health is not improved. For the last twelve months it has been growing steadily worse. My nervous system is shattered. I can not bear noise or tumult or excitement. I dread even to meet strangers. Therefore I think I shall go away and stay during this carnival of a Commencement. I hope that you and Laura will occupy my vacant chamber. The chamber adjoining is already vacant, and I have engaged it for Mrs. Fanning and Electra. I know I have paired your party off differently from your pairing; but then I like the thought of having you and Laura in my deserted chamber. I think I shall go to some very quiet village far from the bustle of company. Forgive me for not remaining to meet you, and set me down as very, very nervous; or, if that will not excuse me in your eyes, set me down as crazy; but never, never as ungrateful or unloving.
<p>Mary.
<p>"P.S. - Mr. Lyle must find accommodations at the hotel."
<p>Having finished, sealed and dispatched this letter, Mary Grey went to work and packed her three great trunks for her journey. That kept her busy all the remainder of the day.
<p>The next morning she dressed herself and went to call upon her friends and bid them good-bye. They were very much surprised at the suddenness of her departure; but she explained to one and all that she rather wished to avoid the crowd, bustle and confusion of Commencement week, and had therefore determined to leave town for a few days, and that her rooms with the bishop's widow would be occupied in the meantime by her friend Miss Cavendish, of Blue Cliffs, and her party.
<p>This made an impression upon all minds that "sweet Mrs. Grey," with her spirit of self-sacrifice, had left town at this most interesting period for no other reason than to give up her quarters to her friends.
<p>Lastly, Mary Grey went to her pastor and obtained from him a letter to the pastor of St. John's Church in Richmond.
<p>Furnished with this, she would obtain entrance into the most respectable society in the city, if she desired to do so.
<p>On the third day from this, Mrs. Grey left Charlottesville for Richmond.
<p>What the Carnival is to Rome, and the Derby is to London, the Commencement week of its great University is to the little country town of Charlottesville.
<p>It is looked forward to for weeks and months. A few days previous to Commencement week the little town begins to fill. The hotels and boarding-houses are crowded with the relatives and friends of the students and professors, and even with numbers of the country gentry, who though they may have no relative at the University yet take an interest in the proceedings of Commencement week.
<p>Emma Cavendish and her friends were therefore peculiarly fortunate in having had comfortable apartments pre-engaged for them.
<p>It was late on the evening of the Monday beginning the important week that they arrived at Charlottesville, and proceeded at once to the house of the bishop's widow.
<p>They found the house hospitably lighted up, and open.
<p>Their hostess, a dignified gentlewoman, received them with great cordiality, and rather as guests than as lodgers.
<p>She showed the ladies to the two communicating rooms on the first floor that they were to occupy - large, airy, pleasant rooms, with a fresh breeze blowing from front to back. Each room had two neat white-draped single beds in it.
<p>"If you please, Mrs. Wheatfield, which of these was Mrs. Grey's apartment?" inquired Emma Cavendish.
<p>"This back room overlooking the flower-garden. But as the front room was unoccupied she had the use of that also, whenever she wished it," answered the bishop's widow.
<p>"I was very sorry to hear from her by letter that she would not be able to remain here to receive us," said Miss Cavendish.
<p>"Ah, my dear, I was just as sorry to have her go away! A sweet woman she is, Miss Cavendish," answered Mrs. Wheatfield.
<p>"Why did she go? Is her health so very bad, Mrs. Wheatfield?"
<p>"My dear, I think that her malady is more of the mind than of the body. But I believe that she went away only to give up these rooms to you and your friends, because there were no other suitable rooms to be obtained for you in Charlottesville."
<p>"I am very sorry to hear that; for indeed I and my companions would rather have given up our journey than have turned Mary Grey out of her rooms. It was really too great a sacrifice on her part," said Emma Cavendish, regretfully.
<p>"My dear, that angel is always making sacrifices, for that matter. But I do think that this sacrifice did not cost her much. Love made it light. I feel sure she was delighted to be able to give up her quarters to friends who could not in any other way have been accommodated in the town," said the bishop's widow, politely.
<p>"I am sorry, however, not to have met her," murmured Emma Cavendish.
<p>"And now, ladies, here are the apartments. Arrange as to their occupancy and distribution among yourselves as you please," said the hostess, as she nodded pleasantly and left the room.
<p>The ladies had brought but little luggage for their week's visit, and it had already arrived and was placed in their rooms.
<p>They washed, dressed their hair, changed their traveling-suits for evening-dresses and went down into the parlor, where they found Alden Lytton - who had walked over from the University to meet his sister - in conversation with Mr. Lyle.
<p>There was quite a joyous greeting. But Alden had to be introduced to Mrs. Fanning, who had changed so much in the years that had passed since their last meeting that the young man would never have known her again.
<p>But every one remarked that when the lady and the student were introduced to each other their mutual agitation could not be concealed. And every one marveled about its cause.
<p>Alden Lytton found fair Emma Cavendish more beautiful than ever, and he now no longer tried to deny to himself the truth that his heart was devoted to her in the purest, highest, noblest love that ever inspired man.
<p>"Do you know, Mr. Lytton, where Mrs. Grey has gone? She did not tell me in her letter where she intended to go; I believe she had not then quite made up her mind as to her destination," said Miss Cavendish.
<p>"I was not even aware of her departure until I learned it from Mrs. Wheatfield this evening," answered Alden Lytton.
<p>"Then no one knows. But I suppose we shall learn when we hear from her," said Emma, with a smile.
<p>Then Alden produced cards for the Commencement, with tickets inclosed for reserved seats in the best part of the hall, which he had been careful to secure for his party. These he gave into the charge of Mr. Lyle, who was to attend the ladies to the University.
<p>And then, as it was growing late, the two gentlemen arose and took leave.
<p>They left the house together and walked down the street as far as the corner, where Alden Lytton paused and said:
<p>"Our ways separate here, I am sorry to say. I have to walk a mile out to the University. Your hotel is about twenty paces up the next street, on your right. You will be sure to find it."
<p>And Alden lifted his hat and was about to stride rapidly away when Mr. Lyle laid his hand on his arm and said:
<p>"One moment. I did not know our paths parted so soon or I might have spoken as we left the house. The fact is, I have a very large sum of money - ten thousand dollars - sent me to be paid to you as soon as you shall have taken your degree. It is to be employed in the purchase of a law library and in the renting and furnishing of a law office in the best obtainable location. I wish to turn this money over to you as soon as possible."
<p>"It is from my unknown guardian, I presume," said Alden, gravely.
<p>"Yes, it is from your unknown guardian."
<p>"Then we will talk of this after the Commencement. I hardly know, Mr. Lyle, whether I ought to accept anything more from this lavish benefactor of ours. I may never be able to repay what we already owe him."
<p>"You need have no hesitation in accepting assistance from this man, as I have often assured you. But, as you say, we will talk of this some other time, when we have more leisure. Good-night!"
<p>And the gentlemen separated: Alden Lytton striding westward toward the University, and Mr. Lyle walking thoughtfully toward his hotel.
<p>His room had been secured and his key was in his pocket, so that he possessed quite an enviable advantage over the crowd of improvident travelers who thronged the office clamoring for quarters, and not half of whom could by any possibility be accommodated.
<p>As it was long after the minister's usual hour for retiring, he walked through the crowded office into the hall and up the stairs to his room - a very small chamber, with one window and a single bed, both window and bed neatly draped with white.
<p>Mr. Lyle sat down in a chair by the one little table, on which stood a bright brass candlestick with a lighted spermaceti candle, and took from his pocket a small Bible, which he opened with the intention of reading his customary chapter before going to bed, when a rap at his door surprised him.
<p>"Come in," he said, supposing that only a country waiter had come with towels or water, or some other convenience.
<p>The door opened and a waiter indeed made his appearance. But he only said:
<p>"A gemman for to see yer, sah!" and ushered in a stranger and closed the door behind him.
<p>Mr. Lyle, much astonished, stared at the visitor, whom he thought he had never seen before.
<p>The stranger was a tall, finely-formed, dark-complexioned and very handsome man, notwithstanding that his raven hair was streaked with silver, his brow lined with thought, and his fine black eyes rather hollow. A full black beard nearly covered the lower part of his face.
<p>"Mr. Lyle," said the visitor, holding out his hand.
<p>"That is my name, sir; but you have the advantage of me," said the minister.
<p>"You do not know me?" inquired the stranger in sad surprise.
<p>"I do not, indeed."
<p>"I am Victor Hartman!"
<p>"Victor Hartman!" exclaimed Mr. Lyle, in a tone of astonishment and joy, as he sprang from his chair and grasped both the hands of the traveler and shook them heartily - "Victor Hartman! My dear friend, I am so delighted - and so surprised - to see you! Sit down - sit down!" he continued, dragging forward a chair and forcing his visitor into it. "But I never should have known you again," he concluded, gazing intently upon the bronzed, gray, tall, broad-shouldered man before him.
<p>"I am much changed," answered the stranger, in a deep, mellifluous voice, that reminded the hearer of sweet, solemn church music.
<p>"Changed! Why, you left us a mere stripling! You return to us a mature man. To all appearance, you might be the father of the boy who went away," said the minister, still gazing upon the stranger.
<p>"And yet the time has not been long; though indeed I have lived much in that period," said the traveler, in the same rich, deep tone, and with a smile that rendered his worn face bright and handsome for the moment.
<p>"Well, I am delighted to see you. But how is it that I have this joyful surprise?" inquired the minister.
<p>"What brings me here, you would ask; and why did I not write and tell you that I was coming?" said Hartman, with an odd smile. "Well, I will explain. When I got your letter acknowledging the receipt of the last remittance I sent to you for my children, I learned for the first time by that same letter that my boy would graduate at this Commencement, and hoped to take the highest honors of his college. Well, a steamer was to sail at noon that very day. I thought I would like to be present at the Commencement and see my boy take his degree. I packed my trunk in an hour, embarked in the 'Porte d'Or' in another hour, and here I am."
<p>"That was prompt. When did you arrive?"
<p>"Our steamer reached New York on Thursday noon. I took the night train for Washington, where I arrived at five on Friday morning. I took the morning boat for Aquia Creek, and the train for Richmond and Charlottesville. I got here about noon."
<p>"And you have not seen your protéges?"
<p>"Yes, I have seen my boy pass the hotel twice to-day. I knew him by his likeness to his unfortunate father. But I did not make myself known to him. I do not intend to do so - at least not at present."
<p>"Why not?"
<p>"Why not?" echoed Hartman, sorrowfully. "Ah, would he not shrink from me in disgust and abhorrence?"
<p>"No; not if he were told the awful injustice that has been done you."
<p>"But if he were told, would he believe it? We have no proof that any injustice has been done me, except those anonymous letters and the word of that strange horseman who waylaid me on my tramp and thrust a bag of gold in my hands, with the words, 'You never intended to kill Henry Lytton, and you never killed him. Some one else intended to kill him, and some one else killed him.'"
<p>"Have you ever heard anything more of that mysterious horseman?"
<p>"Not one word."
<p>"Have you no suspicion of his identity?"
<p>"None, beyond the strong conviction that I feel that he himself was the homicide and the writer of the anonymous letters."
<p>"Well, I can not tell you why, but I always felt persuaded of your innocence, even before the coming of those anonymous letters, and even while you were bitterly accusing yourself."
<p>"You knew it from intuition - inward teaching."
<p>"May I ask you, Hartman, why after you discovered that you had nothing to do with the death of Henry Lytton, you still determined to burden yourself with the support and education of his children - a duty that was first assumed by you as an atonement for an irreparable injury you supposed you had done them?"
<p>"Why I still resolved to care for them after I learned that I had nothing to do with their great loss? Indeed I can not tell you. Perhaps - partly because I sympathized with them in a sorrow that was common to us all, in so far as we all suffered from the same cause; partly, I also think, because it was pleasant to have some one to live for and work for; partly because I was so grateful to find myself free from blood guiltiness that I wished to educate those children as a thank-offering to Heaven! It was also very pleasant to me to think of this boy at college and this girl at school, and to hope that some day they might come to look upon me with affection instead of with horror. And then I took so much pride in talking to my brother miners about my son at the University and my daughter at the Academy! And then, again, your letters - every one of them telling of the progress my children made and the credit they were doing me. I tell you, sir, all this was a great comfort to me, and made me feel at home in this strange, lonesome world," said the exile, warmly.
<p>"Hartman, you have a noble soul! You must have made a very great pecuniary sacrifice for the sake of these young people," said the minister, earnestly.
<p>"No, sir; no sacrifice at all. That was the strangest part of it; for it seemed to me the more I gave the more I had."
<p>"How was that?"
<p>"I don't know how it was, sir; but such was the fact. But I will tell you what I do know."
<p>"Yes, tell me, Hartman."
<p>"You may remember, Mr. Lyle, that when I told you I was going back to California I explained to you that I knew a place where I felt sure money was to be made."
<p>"Yes, I remember."
<p>"Well, sir, the place was a gully at the foot of a certain spur of the mountains, called the Red Cleft. Now, at that time I knew very little of geology. I know more now. Also, I had had but little experience in mining; and, moreover, whenever I mentioned Red Ridge I was simply laughed at by my mates. I was laughed out of giving the place a fair trial. But even after I left the Gold State the idea of the treasure hidden in the gully at the foot of Red Ridge haunted me day and night, something always prompting me to go back there and dig. Sir, it was intuition - inward teaching. When I went back to California I made for Red Ridge. Sir, when I first went to Red Ridge I dug there eight weeks without finding gold. That was the time my mates laughed at me. When I next went back - the time I now speak of - I worked four hours and then struck - struck one of the best paying mines in the Gold State. It is worked by a company now, but I have half of all the shares."
<p>"You have been wonderfully blessed and prospered, Hartman."
<p>"Yes," said the traveler, reverently bowing his head; "for their sakes, I have."
<p>"And for your own, I trust, Hartman."
<p>"Mr. Lyle - "
<p>"Well, Hartman."
<p>"May I ask you a favor?"
<p>"Certainly you may."
<p>"You addressed all your letters to me under the name of Joseph Brent."
<p>"Yes, certainly - at your request."
<p>"Continue, then, to call me Joseph Brent. That name is mine by act of legislature."
<p>"Indeed!"
<p>"Yes, and I have a still better claim. It was the name of my grandfather - my mother's father. It was also the name of his eldest son, my uncle, who died recently a bachelor, in the State of Missouri, and left me his farm there, on condition that I should take his name. I was more anxious to have his name than his estate. So I applied to the legislature, and the name that I had borrowed so long became my own of right."
<p>"So I am to introduce you to my young friends as Mr. Joseph Brent?"
<p>"Yes, if you please. Let the name of poor Victor Hartman sink quietly into the grave. And do not let them know that I was Victor Hartman, or that Joseph Brent was ever their benefactor," said the exile, gravely.
<p>"I will keep your counsel so long as you require me to do so, hoping that the time may speedily come when all shall be made as clear to these young people as it is to me."
<p>"Now when will you introduce me to my children?"
<p>"To-morrow, after the ceremonies are concluded. But, my friend, it is a little strange to hear you call these grown-up young people your children, when you yourself can be but little older than the young man."
<p>"In years, yes. But in long experience, suffering, thought, how much older I am than he is! You yourself said that, to all outward appearance, I might be the father of the boy who went away two years ago."
<p>"Yes, for you are very much changed - not only in your person, but in dress and address."
<p>"You mean that I speak a little more correctly than I used to do? Well, sir, in these two years all the time that was not spent in work was spent in study. Or, rather, as study was to me the hardest sort of work, it would be most accurate to say all the time not spent by me in manual was spent in mental labor. I had had a good public-school education in my boyhood. I wished to recover all I had lost, and to add to it. You see, Mr. Lyle, I did not want my boy and girl to be ashamed of me when, if ever, we should meet as friends," said Hartman, with his old smile.
<p>"That they could never be. Any other than grateful and affectionate they could never be to you - if I know them."
<p>"I believe that too. I believe my children will love me when they understand all."
<p>"Be sure they will. But, Hartman - by the way, I like the name of Hartman, and I hope you will let me use it when we are alone, on condition that I promise never to use it when we are in company."
<p>"As you please, Mr. Lyle."
<p>"Then, Hartman, I was about to say that when I hear you speak of Henry Lytton's son and daughter as your boy and girl, the wonder comes over me as to whether you never think of marriage - of a wife and children of your own."
<p>"Mr. Lyle, since my mother went away to heaven I have never felt any interest in any woman on earth. I have been interested in some girls, but they happened to be children: and I could count them with the fingers of one hand and have a finger or two left over. Let me see," said Hartman, with his odd smile. "First there was Sal's Kid."
<p>"Sal's Kid?" echoed the minister, who had never heard the name before, but thought it a very eccentric one.
<p>"Yes, Sal's Kid - a wild-eyed, elf-locked, olive-skinned little imp, nameless, but nicknamed Sal's Kid, who lived in a gutter called Rat Alley, down by the water-side in New York. I used to be fond of the child when I was cook's galley-boy, and our ship was in port there. I haven't seen her for ten years, yet I've never forgotten her. And I would give a great deal to know whatever became of Sal's Kid. Probably she has gone the way of the rest. They were all beggars, thieves, or worse," added Hartman, with a deep sigh.
<p>"And the next?" inquired the minister, with a wish to recall his visitor from sorrowful thoughts.
<p>"The next girl that interested me," continued Hartman, looking up with a bright smile, as at the recollection of some celestial vision, "was as different from this one as the purest diamond from a lump of charcoal. She was a radiant blonde, with golden hair and sapphire eyes and a blooming complexion. In the darkest hour of my life she appeared to me a heavenly messenger! They were leading me from the Court House to the jail, after my sentence. I was passing amid the hooting crowd, bowed down with despair, when this fair vision beamed upon me and dispersed the furies. She looked at me with heavenly pity in her eyes. She spoke to me and told me to pray, and said that she too would pray for me. At her look and voice the jeering crowd fell back in silence. I thought of that picture of Doré's where the celestial visitant dispersed the fiends. I have never, never seen her since."
<p>"And you do not know who she was?"
<p>"Her companions called her 'Emma.' That is all I know."
<p>"The third girl in whom you became interested?"
<p>"Is my child Laura Lytton, whom I have never seen. During the weeks I was in Mr. Lytton's law office I never once beheld his son or daughter."
<p>"Then personally you are a stranger to both?"
<p>"Yes, personally I am a stranger to both. But to-morrow I hope to know them, although I can not be perfectly made known to them. Remember, Mr. Lyle, I do not wish them to know that I was ever Victor Hartman, or that Joseph Brent was ever their benefactor."
<p>"I will remember your caution. But I will hope, as I said before, for the time when they shall know and esteem you as I know and esteem you."
<p>"Your confidence in me has been, and is, one of my greatest earthly supports," said Hartman, earnestly, as he arose to bid his friend good-night.
<p>Long after his visitor had left him, Mr. Lyle sat at his window in an attitude of deep thought.
<p>The unexpected meeting with Victor Hartman had deprived him of all power or wish to sleep.
<p>He sat at the window watching the crowd that thronged the village streets with his outward eyes, but reviewing all the past with his inner vision. It was long after midnight before he retired.
<p>The next morning revealed the full measure of the crowd that filled the little country town to overflowing. And the road leading from the village westward to the University was crowded with foot-passengers, horsemen and carriages of every description.
<p>Those who had no reserved seats set out early, to secure the most eligible of the unreserved places.
<p>The ceremonies were to commence at twelve noon.
<p>Our party, consisting of Emma Cavendish, Laura Lytton, Electra Coroni, Mrs. Fanning, Mrs. Wheatfield and Dr. Jones occupied the whole of the third form from the front.
<p>They were in their places just a few moments before the overture was played.
<p>The hall was crowded to overflowing. Not only was every form filled, but chairs had to be set in the space between the audience and the orchestra, and also in the middle and side aisles, to accommodate ladies who could not otherwise be seated; while every foot of standing room was occupied by gentlemen.
<p>Mr. Lyle had given up his seat next to Laura Lytton in favor of a lady, and had explained to his party that he had a friend from San Francisco who was present and with whom he could stand up.
<p>And he went away and took up his position in a corner below the platform, beside Victor Hartman, but entirely out of the range of his party's vision.
<p>I will not weary my readers with any detailed account of this Commencement, which resembled all other college commencements in being most interesting to those most concerned.
<p>There was an overture from a new opera.
<p>Then there was an opening oration by one of the learned professors of the University, which was voted by the savants to be a masterpiece of erudition and eloquence, but which the young people present found intolerably dull and stupid. And when the great man sat down a storm of applause followed him.
<p>Then ensued the usual alternation of opera music and orations.
<p>And the young people listened to the opera music, and yawned behind their fans over the orations.
<p>And the savants gave heed to the orations, and closed their senses, if not their ears, to the music.
<p>At length the time for the distribution of the diplomas arrived, and the names of the successful graduates were called out, and each in turn went up to receive his diploma and make the customary deep bow, first to the faculty and then to the audience.
<p>Then followed the offertory of beautiful bouquets and baskets of flowers from friends to the graduates. But the most beautiful offering there was a basket of delicate silver wire filled with fragrant pure white lilies sent by Emma Cavendish to Alden Lytton.
<p>Laura Lytton, in a patriotic mood, sent a bouquet composed of red, white and blue flowers only.
<p>The other ladies of the party sent baskets of geraniums.
<p>The valedictory address was delivered by Alden Lytton, who had, besides, taken the highest honors of the college.
<p>His address was pronounced to be a great success. And his retiring bow was followed by thunders of applause from the audience.
<p>There were several proud and happy fathers there that day; but perhaps the proudest and the happiest man present was Victor Hartman.
<p>With tearful eyes and tremulous tones he said, as he grasped Mr. Lyle's arm:
<p>"My boy pays me for all - my boy pays me for all! He is a grand fellow!"
<p>The people were all going out then.
<p>"Come," said Mr. Lyle, himself moved by the generous emotion of Victor. "Come, let me introduce you to your boy."
<p>"No, not now. Let me go away by myself for a little while. I will see you an hour later at the hotel," said Hartman, as he wrung his friend's hand and turned away.
<p>Mr. Lyle joined his party, with whom he found the most honored graduate of the day, who was holding his silver basket of lilies in his hand and warmly thanking the fair donor.
<p>Mr. Lyle shook hands with Alden and heartily congratulated him on his collegiate honors, adding:
<p>"We shall see you on the Bench yet, Mr. Lytton."
<p>Alden bowed and laughingly replied that he should feel it to be his sacred duty to get there, if he could, in order to justify his friend's good opinion.
<p>"But what have you done with your Californian, Mr. Lyle?" inquired Laura Lytton.
<p>"Sent him back to his hotel. By the way, ladies, he is a stranger here. Will you permit me to bring him to see you this evening?"
<p>"Certainly, Mr. Lyle," promptly replied Emma Cavendish, speaking for all.
<p>But then she gave a questioning glance toward her aunt, the chaperon of the party.
<p>"Of course," said Mrs. Fanning, in answer to that glance. "Of course the Reverend Mr. Lyle's introduction is a sufficient passport for any gentleman to any lady's acquaintance."
<p>Mr. Lyle bowed and said:
<p>"Then I will bring him at eight o'clock this evening."
<p>And, with another bow, he also left the party and hurried off to the hotel.
<p>That evening, at eight o'clock, the three young ladies were seated alone together in the front drawing-room of their boarding-house. Their elderly friends were not present.
<p>Dr. Jones was dining at the college with Alden Lytton and his fellow-graduates.
<p>Mrs. Fanning, fatigued with the day's excitement, had retired to a dressing-gown and sofa in her own room.
<p>Mrs. Wheatfield was in consultation with her book concerning the next day's bill of fare.
<p>Thus the three beauties were left together, and very beautiful they looked.
<p>Emma Cavendish, the "radiant blonde, with the golden hair and sapphire eyes and blooming complexion," was dressed in fine pure white tulle, with light-blue ribbons.
<p>Electra, the wild-eyed, black-haired, damask-cheeked brunette, was dressed in a maize-colored silk, with black lace trimmings.
<p>Laura Lytton, the stout, wholesome, brown-haired and brown-eyed lassie, wore a blue barége trimmed, like Electra's dress, with black lace.
<p>The room was brilliant with gas-light, and they were waiting for their friends and visitors.
<p>Dr. Jones had promised to return, and bring Alden with him, by eight o'clock at latest. And Mr. Lyle had promised to come and bring "the Californian."
<p>The clock struck eight and with dramatic punctuality the bell rang.
<p>The next moment the little page of the establishment opened the drawing-room door and announced:
<p>"Mr. Lyle and a gemman."
<p>The three young ladies looked up, to see Mr. Lyle enter the room, accompanied by a tall, finely-formed, dark-complexioned man, with deep dark eyes, and black hair and full black beard, both lightly streaked with silver, which, together with a slight stoop, gave him the appearance of being much older than he really was.
<p>Mr. Lyle bowed to the young ladies, and then, taking his companion up to Emma Cavendish, he said, with old-fashioned formality:
<p>"Miss Cavendish, permit me to present to you my friend Mr. Brent, of San Francisco."
<p>"I am glad to see you, Mr. Brent," said the young lady, with a graceful bend of her fair head.
<p>But in an instant the Californian seemed to have lost his self-possession.
<p>He stared for a moment almost rudely at the young lady: he turned red and pale, drew a long breath; then, with an effort, recovered himself and bowed deeply.
<p>Miss Cavendish was surprised; but she was too polite and self-possessed to let her surprise appear. She mentally ascribed the disturbance of her visitor to some passing cause.
<p>Mr. Lyle, who had not noticed his companion's agitation, now presented him to Laura Lytton and to Electra Coroni.
<p>To Laura he bowed gravely and calmly.
<p>But when he met the wild eyes of Electra he started violently and exclaimed:
<p>"Sal's - " then stopped abruptly, bowed and took the chair that his friend placed for him.
<p>He sat in perfect silence, while Emma Cavendish, pitying, without understanding, his awkwardness, tried to make conversation by introducing the subject of California and the gold mines.
<p>But Victor Hartman replied with an effort, and frequently and furtively looked at Emma, and looked at Electra, and then put his hand to his head in a perplexed manner.
<p>At length his embarrassment became obvious even to unobservant Mr. Lyle, who longed for an opportunity of asking him what the matter was.
<p>But before that opportunity came there was another ring at the street door-bell, followed by the entrance of Dr. Jones and Alden Lytton.
<p>The last-comers greeted the young ladies and Mr. Lyle, and acknowledged the presence of the stranger with a distant bow.
<p>But then Mr. Lyle arose and asked permission to introduce his friend Mr. Brent, of California.
<p>And Dr. Jones and Mr. Lytton shook hands with the Californian and welcomed him to Virginia.
<p>Then Alden Lytton, who had some dim dreams of going to California to commence life, with the idea of one day becoming Chief Justice of the State, began to draw the stranger out on the subject.
<p>Victor Hartman, the unknown and unsuspected benefactor, delighted to make the acquaintance of "his boy," and, to learn all his half-formed wishes and purposes, talked freely and enthusiastically of the Gold State and its resources and prospects.
<p>"If all that I have heard about the condition of society out there be true, however, it must be a much better place for farmers and mechanics, tradesmen and laborers, than for professional men."
<p>"What have you heard, then, of the condition of society out there?" inquired Victor.
<p>"Well, I have heard that the climate is so healthy that the well who go there never get sick, and the sick who go there get well without the doctor's help. And, furthermore, that all disputes are settled by the fists, the bowie-knife, or the revolver, without the help of lawyer, judge or jury! So, you see, if all that is told of it is true, it is a bad place for lawyers and doctors."
<p>"'If all that is told of it is true?' There is not a word of it true! It is all an unpardonable fabrication," said Victor Hartman, so indignantly and solemnly that Alden burst out laughing as he answered:
<p>"Oh, of course I know it is an exaggeration! I did think of trying my fortune in the Gold State; but upon reflection I have decided to devote my poor talents to my mother state, Virginia. And not until she practically disowns me will I desert her."
<p>"Well said, my dear bo - I mean Mr. Lytton!" assented the Californian.
<p>He had begun heartily, but ended by correcting himself with some embarrassment.
<p>Alden looked up for an instant, a little surprised by his disturbance; but ascribed it to the awkwardness of a man long debarred from ladies' society, as this miner seemed to have been.
<p>Gradually Victor Hartman recovered his composure and talked intelligently and fluently upon the subject of gold mining, Chinese emigration, and so forth.
<p>Only when he would chance to meet the full gaze of Electra's "wild eyes," or catch the tones of Emma's mellifluous voice, then, indeed, he would show signs of disturbance. He would look or listen, and put his hand to his forehead with an expression of painful perplexity.
<p>At ten o'clock the gentlemen arose to bid the young ladies good-night.
<p>It was then arranged that the whole party should visit the University the next day and go through all the buildings on a tour of inspection.
<p>When the visitors had gone, Electra suddenly inquired:
<p>"Well, what do you think of the Californian?"
<p>"I think him very handsome," said Laura, "but decidedly the most awkward man I ever saw in all the days of my life. Except in the matter of his awkwardness he seems to be a gentleman."
<p>"Oh, that is nothing! One of the most distinguished men I ever met in my father's house - a gentleman by birth, education and position, a statesman of world-wide renown - was unquestionably the most awkward human being I ever saw in my life. He knew very well how to manage men and nations, but he never knew what to do with his feet and hands: he kept shuffling them about in the most nervous and distracting manner," said Emma Cavendish, in behalf of the stranger.
<p>"Somehow or other that man's face haunts me like a ghost," mused Electra, dreamily.
<p>"So it does me," quickly spoke Emma. "I feel sure that I have met those sad, wistful dark eyes somewhere before."
<p>"I'll tell you both what. Whether you have ever met him before or not, he thinks he has seen you. He seemed to me to be trying to recollect where all the evening," said Laura Lytton, with her air of positiveness.
<p>"Then that might account for his awkwardness and embarrassment," added Emma.
<p>"But he is certainly very handsome," concluded Electra, as she took her candle to retire.
<p>Meanwhile the four gentlemen walked down the street together to a corner, where they bade each other good-night and separated - Dr. Jones and Alden Lytton to walk out to the University, and Mr. Lyle and Victor Hartman to go to their hotel.
<p>"What on earth was the matter with you, Victor?" inquired Mr. Lyle, as they walked on together.
<p>"What?" exclaimed Hartman, under his breath, and stopping short in the street.
<p>"Yes, what! I never saw a man so upset without an adequate cause in all my life."
<p>"Don't let us go into the house yet," said Victor; for they were now before the door of the hotel. "It is only ten o'clock, and a fine night. Take a turn with me down some quiet street, and I will tell you."
<p>"Willingly," agreed Mr. Lyle; and they walked past the hotel and out toward the suburbs of the little town.
<p>"Mr. Lyle, I have seen them both!" exclaimed Victor, when they were out of hearing of every one else.
<p>"Both? Whom have you seen, Hartman?" inquired the minister a little uneasily, as if he feared his companion was not quite sane.
<p>"First, I have seen again the heavenly vision that appeared and dispersed the furies from around me on that dark day when I passed, a condemned criminal, from the Court House to the jail," replied Victor Hartman, with emotion.
<p>"Hartman, my poor fellow, are you mad?"
<p>"No; but it was enough to make me so. To meet one of them, whom I never expected to see again in this world, would have been enough to upset me for a while; but to meet both, and to meet them together, who were so widely apart in place and in rank, I tell you it was bewildering! I felt as if I was under the influence of opium and in a delightful dream from which I should soon awake. I did not quite believe it all to be real. I do not quite believe it to be so yet. Have I seen that celestial visitant again?" he inquired, putting his hand to his head in the same confused manner.
<p>"Now, which one of these young ladies do you take to have been your 'celestial visitant,' as you most absurdly call her?"
<p>"Oh, the fair, golden-haired, azure-eyed angel, robed so appropriately in pure white!"
<p>"That was Miss Emma Cavendish," said Mr. Lyle, very uneasily; "and you talk of her like a lover, Hartman - and like a very mad lover too! But oh, I earnestly implore you, do not become so very mad, so frenzied as to let yourself love Emma Cavendish! By birth, education and fortune she is one of the first young ladies in the country, and a bride for a prince. Do not, I conjure you, think of loving her yourself!"
<p>Victor Hartman laughed a little light laugh, that seemed to do him good, as he answered:
<p>"Do not be afraid. I worship her too much to think of loving her in the way you mean. And, besides, if I am not greatly mistaken, my boy has been before me."
<p>"Alden Lytton?"
<p>"Yes, sir. I saw it all. I was too much interested not to see it. My boy and my angel like one another. Heaven bless them both! They are worthy of each other. They will make a fine pair. He so handsome; she so beautiful! He so talented; she so lovely! His family is quite as good as hers. And as for a fortune, his shall equal hers!" said Victor, warmly.
<p>"Will you give away all your wealth to make your 'boy' happy?" inquired Mr. Lyle, with some emotion.
<p>"No! The Red Cleft mine is not so easily exhausted. Besides, in any case, I should save something for my girl She must have a marriage portion too!"
<p>"You really ought to have a guardian appointed by the court to take care of you and your money, Victor. You will give it all away. And, seriously, it grieves me to see you so inclined to rob yourself so heavily to enrich others, even such as these excellent young people," said Mr. Lyle, with feeling.
<p>"Be easy! When I have enriched them both I shall still have an unexhausted gold mine! By the way, parson - parson!"
<p>"Well, Hartman?"
<p>"I saw something else beside the love between my angel and my boy. I saw - saw a certain liking between my girl and my friend."
<p>If the bright starlight had been bright enough Victor Hartman might have seen the vivid blush that mantled all over the ingenuous face of Stephen Lyle.
<p>"I certainly admire Miss Lytton very much. She is a genuine girl," said Mr. Lyle, as composedly as if his face was not crimson.
<p>"And I see she certainly admires you very much. She evidently thinks you are a genuine man. So, my dear friend, go in and win. And my girl shall not miss her marriage portion," said Hartman, cordially.
<p>Mr. Lyle was beginning to feel a little embarrassed at the turn the conversation had taken, so he hastened to change it by saying:
<p>"You told me that you had met them both whom you never had expected to see again in this world. One was Miss Cavendish, your 'heavenly vision;' who was the other?"
<p>"Can you be at a loss to know? There were but three young ladies present. My own girl, whom I went to see and did expect to meet; Miss Cavendish, whom you have just identified as one of the two alluded to, and the brilliant little creature whom you introduced by a heathenish sort of name which I have forgotten."
<p>"Miss Electra?"
<p>"Aye, that was the name; but however you call her, I knew her in Rat Alley as Sal's Kid."
<p>"What!" exclaimed Mr. Lyle, stopping short and trying to gaze through the darkness into the face of his companion; for Mr. Lyle had never happened to hear of the strange vicissitudes of Electra's childhood.
<p>"She is Sal's Kid, I do assure you. Her face is too unique ever to be mistaken. I could never forget or fail to recognize those flashing eyes and gleaming teeth. And, I tell you, I would rather have found her again as I found her to-night than have discovered another gold mine as rich as that of Red Cleft."
<p>"Hartman, you were never more deceived in your life. That young lady, Electra Coroni, is the granddaughter of Dr. Beresford Jones, and is the sole heiress of Beresford Manors. She was educated at the Mount Ascension Academy for Young Ladies in this State, from which she has just graduated."
<p>"Whoever she is, or whatever she is, or wherever she lives now, when I knew her she was Sal's Kid, and lived in Rat Alley, New York. And she knew me as Galley Vick, the ship cook's boy."
<p>"Hartman, you have certainly 'got a bee in your bonnet!'"
<p>"We shall see. She almost recognized me to-night. She will quite know me soon," answered Victor, as they turned their steps toward their hotel.
<p>The next morning at the appointed hour the Rev. Mr. Lyle and Victor Hartman left their hotel together and went to Mrs. Wheatfield's, to escort the ladies to the University, where Dr. Jones and Alden Lytton were to meet them and introduce them to the president. The two gentlemen found the young ladies already dressed and waiting.
<p>Miss Cavendish explained that her aunt did not care about seeing more of the University than she had already seen, and preferred to remain in the house with the bishop's widow and rest that day.
<p>And so, under the circumstances, they - Miss Cavendish and her young friends - had decided not to have a carriage, but to take advantage of the fine morning and walk the short mile that lay between the village and its great seat of learning.
<p>Nothing could have pleased their escorts better than this plan.
<p>And soon they - the party of five - set out upon the pleasant country road that led out to the University.
<p>Emma Cavendish and Laura Lytton led the way, and by Laura's side walked the Rev. Mr. Lyle. Electra dropped a little behind, and was attended by Victor Hartman.
<p>They talked of the fine morning and of the beautiful country, of the grand Commencement of the preceding day and of the University they were going to see; but they talked in an absent-minded manner, as if, indeed, they were both thinking of something else.
<p>This lasted until they were half-way to the place, when at length Electra turned suddenly upon Victor and said:
<p>"Do you know, Mr. Brent, that your face seems a very familiar one to me?"
<p>"Indeed!" said Victor, bending his head nearer to her.
<p>"Yes, indeed! Your face struck me as being familiar the first moment I saw you, and this impression has grown deeper every moment we have been walking together; and now I know of whom you remind me," answered Electra; and then she paused and looked at him.
<p>He made no remark.
<p>"You do not care to know who that was, it seems," she said.
<p>"Oh, yes, I do, I assure you, Miss Coroni, if you please to tell me!"
<p>"Then you remind me of a poor lad whom I once knew and liked very much in New York, when I was as poor as himself," said Electra, meaningly.
<p>"It is very kind of you to remember the poor lad after so many years and so many changes," replied Victor.
<p>"I wonder if that poor lad ever thinks of me, 'after so many years and so many changes?'" murmured Electra, musingly.
<p>"I don't know. Tell me his name, and then perhaps I can answer your question. I have roamed around the world a good deal and seen a great many different sorts of people. Who knows but I may have met your poor lad? Let us have his name," said Victor, gravely.
<p>They were both, to use a household phrase, "beating about the bush."
<p>"Oh, he was too poor to own a name! But he was cook's boy on board a merchantman, and they called him 'Galley Vick.' I never knew him by any other name. Did you ever see him at all?"
<p>"Oh, yes, I've seen him! A good-for-nothing little vagabond he was! No, I don't suppose he ever dares to think about such a fine young lady as you are. But he cherishes the memory of a poor little girl he once knew in Rat Alley, New York. And only the day before yesterday, when I happened to be with him, he was saying how much he would give to know what had become of that poor little girl."
<p>"Yes, it was very nice of him to remember her," said Electra, musingly.
<p>"You say that you knew the poor lad in New York. Perhaps, as they were so much together, you may have known the poor little girl also?" said Victor.
<p>"I can not tell you unless you give me her name. There were so many poor little girls in New York," answered Electra, shaking her head.
<p>"She, like the boy, was too poor then to own a name. They called her 'Sal's Kid.' I never knew her by any other name," answered Victor.
<p>And then their eyes met, and both laughed and impulsively put out their hands, which were then clasped together.
<p>"I knew you at the very first sight, Vick," said Electra, giving full way to her feelings of pleasure in meeting her old playmate again.
<p>"And so did I you. Heaven bless you, child! I am so happy and thankful to find you here, so healthy and prosperous. You were a sickly, poor little thing when I knew you," said Victor, with much emotion.
<p>"I was a famished poor little thing, you mean, food has made all the difference, Victor," laughed Electra.
<p>"My name is Joseph Brent, my dear," said Hartman, who almost trembled to hear the old name spoken.
<p>"Ah, but Sal's Kid knew you only as Galley Vick. I thought Vick was the short for Victor. But it seems you really had a name all the time as well as I had, though neither of us suspected we possessed such an appendage."
<p>Hartman bowed in silence.
<p>"And now I suppose you would like to know how it happens that you find poor little ragged, famished, sickly Sal's Kid, who used to live in Rat Alley among thieves and tramps, here - well lodged, well dressed and in good company?"
<p>"Yes, I really would."
<p>"Well, it was 'all along of' a grandfather."
<p>"A grandfather!"
<p>"Yes, a grandfather. I really had a grandfather! And I have him still. And you have seen him, and his name is Dr. Beresford Jones. And, moreover, I had a great-grandfather back of him; and also forefathers behind them, and ancestors extending away back to antiquity. In fact, I think they ran away back to Adam!"
<p>"I dare say they did," answered Victor, with a smile; "but tell me about that grandfather."
<p>"Well, you must know that he was wealthy. He owned Beresford Manors. He had one child, 'sole daughter of the house.' She married a poor young Italian music-master against her father's will. Her father cast her off. Her husband took her to New York, where they fell by degrees into the deepest destitution. They both died of cholera, leaving me to the care of the miserable beings who were their fellow-lodgers in the old tenement house. I believe I was passed from the hands of one beggar to those of another, until my identity was lost and my real name forgotten. But I do not clearly remember any of my owners except Sal. And I was called 'Sal's Kid.'"
<p>"It was then I knew you," said Victor.
<p>"So it was. Well, you know all about that period. It was soon after you went to sea that Sal's husband, being mad with drink and jealousy, struck his wife a fatal blow and killed her."
<p>"Horrible!"
<p>"Yes, horrible! I have heard since that the man died of mania-à-potu in the Tombs, before his trial came on."
<p>"And you?"
<p>"I was taken by the Commissioners of Charity and put into the Orphan Asylum at Randall's Island."
<p>"And how did your grandfather ever find you there, where your very name was lost?"
<p>"You may well ask that. My name was lost. I suppose, hearing me called Sal's Kid, they mistook that for Sal Kidd. Any way they registered my name on the books of the Island as Sarah Kidd."
<p>Victor laughed at this piece of ingenuity on the part of the authorities, and again expressed wonder as to how her grandfather ever found her.
<p>"If I were a heathen, I should say he found me by chance. It looked like it. You see, he had met with misfortunes. His wife - my grandmother - died. And he was growing old, and his home was lonely and his life was dreary. And so he relented toward his poor daughter, and even toward her husband."
<p>"But too late!" put in Victor.
<p>"Yes; too late. He relented too late," sighed Electra. "He went to New York, where they had been living when he had last heard of them, and after making the most diligent inquiries he only learned that they had been dead several years, and had left an orphan girl in great destitution. Well, he advertised for the child, offering large rewards for her discovery."
<p>"But in vain, I suppose?" said Victor.
<p>"Ah, yes, in vain, for I was at Randall's Island, registered under another name."
<p>"The case seemed hopeless," said Victor.
<p>"Entirely hopeless. And then, partly from his disappointment and partly from seeing so much of suffering among children, he became a sort of city missionary. It was in his character of missionary that he went one day to an examination of the pupils of the girls' school on Randall's Island. There he saw me, and recognized me by my striking likeness to my mother. Indeed he has since told me that I am a counterpart of what my mother was at my age."
<p>"And your face is such a very peculiar and, I may say, unique face, that the likeness could not have been accidental, I suppose," observed Victor.
<p>"That is what he thought. Well, without saying a word to me then of his recognition, he commenced with the slight clew that he had in his hands and pursued investigations that in a few days proved me to be the child of Sebastian and Electra Coroni. Then he came to the Island and took me away, and put me to school at Mount Ascension. There I made the acquaintance of the young lady friend that I am now staying with. Miss Cavendish is my cousin. Last month I graduated from Mount Ascension. And on the first of next month I am going to Beresford Manors, to commence my new life there as my grandfather's housekeeper. And, Victor - I beg your pardon! - Mr. Brent, I hope that you will come and visit us there," concluded Electra, with a smile.
<p>"But how would your grandfather, Dr. Beresford Jones of Beresford Manors, take a visit from a poor adventurer like me?" inquired Victor.
<p>"He will take it very kindly; for he also will ask you to come," said Electra.
<p>Victor bowed and walked on in silence.
<p>Electra spoke again:
<p>"I have told you without reserve how it was that I was so suddenly raised from extreme poverty to wealth, and now - "
<p>She paused and looked at her companion.
<p>"And now you want to know how I came by my fortune?" smilingly inquired Victor.
<p>"Yes, of course I do," answered Electra.
<p>"The explanation is short and simple enough. I became suddenly rich, as some few other poor vagabonds have, by a fortunate stroke of the pick - by a California gold mine," quietly answered Victor.
<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Electra.
<p>And she stopped and put him away from her a step, and stood and stared at him.
<p>Victor laughed. And then they went on, for their companions were at the gates of the University, waiting for them to come along.
<p>They entered the beautiful grounds occupied by the extensive buildings of the University, and where several of the professors, as well as a few of the students who had not yet left for the vacation, were taking their morning walks.
<p>The visitors were soon met by Dr. Jones and Alden Lytton, who came up together to welcome them.
<p>After the usual greetings, Alden introduced his party to several of the professors, who received them with great courtesy, and attended them through the various buildings, pointing out to them the most notable objects of interest, and entertaining them with the history, statistics and anecdotes of the institution.
<p>They were taken into the various libraries, where they saw collected vast numbers of the most valuable books, among which were a few very unique black letter and illuminated volumes of great antiquity.
<p>They were then led into the several halls, where were collected costly astronomical and chemical apparatus.
<p>And finally they visited the museum, filled with cabinets of minerals, shells, woods, fossils, and so forth.
<p>And after an interesting but very fatiguing tour of inspection, that occupied four hours, they were invited to rest in the house of one of the professors, where they were refreshed with a dainty lunch, after which they returned to the village.
<p>And the evening was spent socially in Mrs. Wheatfield's drawing-room.
<p>In the course of that evening they were surprised by a visit. It was from Mr. Craven Kyte, who came to call on Miss Cavendish.
<p>He was invited into the drawing-room and introduced to the whole party.
<p>Mr. Kyte was in the deepest state of despondency.
<p>He told Miss Emma that a few days previous he had received a letter from Mrs. Grey, saying that she was about to leave Charlottesville for a little while, in order to give up her rooms to Miss Cavendish and her party, and that she did not know exactly where she should go, but that she would write and tell him as soon as she should get settled.
<p>"And since that, Miss Emma, I have not heard one word from her, nor do I know where she is, or how she is, or how to find out," concluded Mr. Kyte, in the most dejected tone.
<p>"How long has it been, Mr. Kyte?" inquired Miss Cavendish.
<p>"Five days," answered the young man, as solemnly as if he had said five years.
<p>"That is but a short time. I do not think you have cause to be anxious yet awhile," said Emma, with a smile.
<p>"But you haven't heard from her yourself even, have you, Miss Emma?" he anxiously inquired.
<p>"Certainly not, else I should have told you at once," replied Miss Cavendish.
<p>"For mercy's sake, you never came all the way from Wendover to Charlottesville to ask that question, did you, Mr. Kyte?" inquired irrepressible Electra, elevating her eye-brows.
<p>The lover, who had so unconsciously betrayed himself, blushed violently and stammered forth:
<p>"No - not entirely. The fact is, for more than a year past I have been watching and waiting for an opportunity to change my business from Wendover to Charlottesville. And I came up partly about that also. But as a - a friend of Mrs. Grey, I do feel anxious about her mysterious absence and silence."
<p>"I assure you, Mr. Kyte, that Mrs. Grey is quite capable of taking excellent care of herself," added plain-spoken Laura Lytton.
<p>"Come, Mr. Kyte, cheer up! We are going on a pilgrimage to Monticello to-morrow and you must join our party," said Miss Cavendish, kindly.
<p>But Mr. Kyte excused himself, saying that he could not leave his business long, and must start for Wendover the next morning.
<p>And soon after this he took leave.
<p>The next day was devoted by our party to a pious pilgrimage to the shrine of classic Monticello, once the seat, now the monument of Thomas Jefferson.
<p>The whole party, young and old, gentlemen and ladies, went.
<p>The bishop's widow forgot her housekeeping cares and took a holiday for that day.
<p>And even Mrs. Fanning, who did not care to see the great University, could not miss the opportunity of a pilgrimage to that mecca.
<p>The party was a large one, consisting of five ladies and four gentlemen.
<p>And so it required two capacious carriages and two saddle horses to convey them.
<p>They formed quite a little procession in leaving the village.
<p>In the first carriage rode Mrs. Fanning, Emma Cavendish, Electra and Dr. Jones.
<p>In the second carriage rode Mrs. Wheatfield, Laura Lytton and Mr. Lyle.
<p>Alden Lytton and Victor Hartman rode on horseback, and brought up the rear.
<p>Their way lay through the most sublime and beautiful mountain and valley scenery.
<p>Monticello is built upon a mountain, some three miles south of the village.
<p>Perhaps there is no private dwelling in the whole country occupying a more elevated site, or commanding a more magnificent panorama of landscape, than Monticello.
<p>It is a fine country house of great architectural beauty and strength, built upon a lofty and slightly inclined plain, formed by grading the top of the mountain.
<p>It commands a stupendous prospect, bounded only by the spherical form of the earth. And standing there, with the earth beneath and the heavens all around, one fully realizes that we live upon a great planet rolling in its orbit through immense space.
<p>Our party spent a long summer's day up there in the sunshine, and then, after eating the luncheon they had brought with them, they set out on their return to the village, where they arrived in time for one of Mrs. Wheatfield's delicious early teas.
<p>The remaining days of the week were passed in walking, riding or driving to the most interesting points of the neighborhood.
<p>On Saturday morning they took leave of the bishop's widow and set out for Richmond, en route for Wendover and Blue Cliffs.
<p>They reached the city late on the same night, and took up their old quarters at the Henrico House.
<p>They staid over the Sabbath, and went to hear Mr. Lyle preach, morning and evening, to his old congregation.
<p>On Monday morning the whole party resumed their journey, and arrived at Wendover early in the afternoon of the same day.
<p>There the party were destined to divide.
<p>There were carriages from Blue Cliffs waiting by appointment at the railway station to meet Miss Cavendish and her friends; and there was the hack from the Reindeer Hotel for the accommodation of any other travelers who might require it.
<p>Mrs. Fanning, Emma Cavendish, Laura Lytton and Electra, attended by Dr. Jones and Alden Lytton, entered their carriages to go to Blue Cliff Hall.
<p>Mr. Lyle and Victor Hartman took leave of them at their carriage doors, saw the horses start, and then set out to walk together to the bachelor home of Mr. Lyle, where Hartman was to be a guest.
<p>Mr. Lyle lived in a pretty white cottage, covered nearly to the roof with fragrant creeping vines, and standing in the midst of a beautiful flower-garden.
<p>Here he lived his bachelor life quite alone but for the occasional sight of the old negro couple that were waiting on him - Aunt Nancy, who did all his housework, and Uncle Ned, who worked in the garden.
<p>He found the faithful old couple prepared to receive him and his guest.
<p>A tempting repast, combining the attractions of dinner and tea, was ready to be placed upon the table just as soon as the gentlemen should have made their toilets after their long journey.
<p>Mr. Lyle led his guest into a fresh, pretty room, with white muslin curtains at the vine-clad windows and a white dimity spread on the bed, and white flower enameled cottage furniture completing the appointments.
<p>"This is a room for a pretty girl rather than for a grim miner," said Victor Hartman, looking admiringly around the little apartment.
<p>"I call it the 'Chamber of Peace,' and that is why I put you in it," said Mr. Lyle.
<p>After they had washed and dressed they went down together to the cozy little dining-room, where they did such justice to the tea-dinner as made Aunt Nancy's heart crow for joy.
<p>And when that was over they went into the snug little parlor and sat down to talk over their plans.
<p>It was then that Mr. Lyle informed Victor Hartman that he was doing all the work of the parish during Dr. Goodwin's hopeless indisposition, and that he had been doing it for the last twelve months.
<p>"You will succeed him here as rector, I presume?" said Victor.
<p>"I presume so; but I do not like to speak of that," gravely replied Mr. Lyle.
<p>"No, of course you do not. And I really beg your pardon. I should not have spoken myself, only in my girl's interests. You see, I felt a little curious and anxious to know where her future life would be likely to be passed, and I thought it would be a much happier life if passed here, near her dear friend Miss Cavendish, that's all," explained Victor.
<p>"You seem to consider that quite a settled matter," replied Mr. Lyle, a little incoherently, and blushing like a maiden.
<p>"Yes, of course I consider it all quite settled! You, in your earnestness, can not conceal your liking for my girl, and she, in her innocent frankness, does not even try to conceal hers from you. And I heartily approve the match and am ready to dower the bride," said Victor.
<p>"But I have not ventured to speak to her yet," stammered Mr. Lyle.
<p>"Then you may do so just as soon as you please," answered Victor.
<p>"And now about Alden," said Mr. Lyle, by way of changing the conversation.
<p>"Yes, now about Alden. He does not suspect that I am his banker, I hope?"
<p>"No, indeed! I paid him over the munificent sum you intrusted to me for him. He feels - well, I may say painfully grateful, and is confident that he must some time repay you, with interest and compound interest."
<p>"Yes, my boy will certainly repay me, but not in the way he thinks," observed Victor, gravely.
<p>"After a week's visiting with his sister at Blue Cliffs, he will go up to Richmond and select a site for his office and purchase his law library, though I think he will have to go to Philadelphia to do that."
<p>"Yes, I suppose he will," admitted Hartman.
<p>"What are your own plans about yourself, Victor, if I may be allowed to ask?" inquired the minister.
<p>"Well, I haven't any. I came on here to see my boy and girl, and settle them in life as well as I can. I shall stay till I do that anyway. After that I don't know what I shall do. I do not care about going back to California. My business there is in the hands of a capable and trustworthy agent. And somehow I like the old mother State; and now that you lead me to think about it, perhaps I shall spend the rest of my life here; but, as I said before, I don't know."
<p>"By the way, dear Victor, you spoke to me with much simple frankness of my most private personal affairs. May I take the same liberty with you?" inquired Mr. Lyle, very seriously.
<p>"Why, of course you may, if you call it a liberty, which I don't, you know!" answered Victor, with a smile.
<p>"Then, my dear Hartman, how about Miss Electra? I was not so absorbed in my own interests as not to have an eye to yours."
<p>"Ah, Miss Electra! Well, parson, she was my little old acquaintance of Rat Alley, when I flourished in that fragrant neighborhood as Galley Vick."
<p>"No!" exclaimed Mr. Lyle, opening his eyes wide with astonishment.
<p>"Yes," quietly answered Victor Hartman. "And it is a wonder that you, who know the family so well, do not know this episode in its history."
<p>"How was I to know, my friend, when no one ever told me? I suppose that few or none but the family know anything about it."
<p>"I suppose you are right," said Victor. "Well, you see, she recognized me, as surely as I did her, at first sight. We had an explanation as we walked out to the University that day."
<p>"But how came the granddaughter of Dr. Beresford Jones ever to have had such a miserable childhood?"
<p>"Well, you see, there was a disobedient daughter, a runaway marriage, a profligate husband, and the consequences - poverty, destitution, early death, and an orphan child left among beggars and thieves! Her grandfather found her at last and took her under his guardianship. That is the whole story in brief."
<p>"Well, well, well!" mused Mr. Lyle, with his head on his breast; then, raising it, he went back to the previous question: "But what about Miss Electra?"
<p>"I have just told you about her," replied Victor.
<p>"Oh, yes, I know! You have told me something about her, but you haven't told me all. Take me into your confidence, Victor."
<p>"What do you mean?" inquired Hartman, in some embarrassment.
<p>"Why, that you and your little old acquaintance seem to be very fond of each other."
<p>Victor laughed in an embarrassed manner, and then said: "Do you know that when we were in Rat Alley, and she was a tiny child and I was a lad, there was a promise of marriage between us?"
<p>"That was funny too! Well, what about it?"
<p>"Nothing. Only, if I dared, I would, some day, remind her of it."
<p>"Do, Victor! Believe me, she will not affect to have forgotten it," said Mr. Lyle, earnestly.
<p>"Ah, but when I think of all I have passed through I dare not ask a beautiful and happy girl to unite her bright life with my blackened one! I dare not," said Hartman, very sadly.
<p>"Nonsense, Victor! You are morbid on that subject. Yours is a nobly redeemed life," said Mr. Lyle, solemnly.
<p>"But - my past!" sighed Victor.
<p>"She had a dark past too poor child! But no more of that. In both your cases
<p>And now it is time to retire, dear Victor. We keep early hours here," said Mr. Lyle, as he reached down the Bible from its shelf, preparatory to commencing evening service.
<p>Then they read the Word together, and offered up their prayers and thanksgivings together, and retired, strengthened.
<p>This week, to which Alden Lytton's holiday visit to Blue Cliffs was limited, was passed by the young people in a succession of innocent entertainments.
<p>First there was a garden-party and dance at Blue Cliff Hall, at which all the young friends and acquaintances of Miss Cavendish assisted, which the Rev. Dr. Jones and the Rev. Mr. Lyle endorsed by their presence, and in which even Victor Hartman forgot, for the time being, his own dark antecedents.
<p>Next Mr. Lyle himself opened his bachelor heart and bachelor home to the young folks by giving them a tea-party, which delighted the hearts of Aunt Nancy and Uncle Ned, who both declared that this looked something like life.
<p>But the third and greatest event of the week took place on Friday evening, when Dr. Beresford Jones gave a great house-warming party, on the occasion of his carrying home his granddaughter and sole heiress, Electra Coroni.
<p>Not only all our own young friends, including the reverend clergy and the California miner, but all the neighborhood and all the county were there.
<p>And they kept up the festivities all day and well into the night.
<p>Emma Cavendish and Laura Lytton remained with Electra for a few days only, for Alden Lytton was to leave the neighborhood for Richmond on the Monday morning following the party at Beresford Manors.
<p>And during all this time no word was heard of Mary Grey.
<p>That baleful woman had heard all that had passed at Charlottesville and at Wendover, and her vain and jealous spirit was filled with such mortification and rage that she was now hiding herself and deeply plotting the ruin of those who had been her best friends and benefactors.
<p>When Mary Grey reached Richmond she went first to a quiet family hotel, where she engaged a room for a few days.
<p>Then she took a carriage and drove to the rectory of old St. John's Church and presented her letter to the rector.
<p>The reverend gentleman received her very kindly and cordially, and glanced over her letter, saying, as he returned it to her:
<p>"But this was not at all necessary, my dear madam. I remember you perfectly, as a regular attendant and communicant of this church, while you were on a visit to the family of the late lamented Governor of this State."
<p>"Yes, sir; but then I was only a visitor at the church, just as I was a guest at the Government House. Now I wish to be a member of the church, as I intend to become a permanent resident of the city," Mary Grey explained, with her charming smile.
<p>The pastor expressed himself highly gratified, and added:
<p>"Your large circle of friends, that you won during your long visit here two or three years ago, will be delighted to hear of this."
<p>Mary Grey bowed gracefully and said:
<p>"The pleasure, she believed, would, like the advantage, be mostly on her own side."
<p>Then she inquired of the rector - with an apology for troubling him with her own humble affairs - whether he could recommend her to any private boarding-house among the members of his own church, where the family were really earnest Christians.
<p>The rector could not think of any suitable place just then, but he begged to have the pleasure of introducing Mrs. Grey to his wife, who, he said, would most likely be able to advise her.
<p>And he rang the bell and sent a message to Mrs.  - - , who presently entered the study.
<p>The introduction took place, and the rector's wife received the visitor as cordially as the rector had.
<p>She knew of no boarding-house of the description required by Mrs. Grey, but she promised to inquire among her friends and let that lady know the result.
<p>Soon after this Mrs. Grey took leave.
<p>Many of her former friends were, at this season of the year, out of town, as she felt sure; but some among them would probably be at home.
<p>So, before she returned to her hotel, she made a round of calls, and left her cards at about a dozen different houses.
<p>She then went back to her room at the hotel and spent the remainder of the day in unpacking and reviewing her elegant wardrobe.
<p>There was no sort of necessity for doing this, especially as she intended to remain but a few days at the house; and the operation would only give her the trouble of repacking again to move.
<p>But Mary Grey never read or wrote or sewed or embroidered if she could avoid it, and had nothing on earth else to occupy or amuse her; so her passion for dress had to be gratified with the sight of jewels, shawls and mantles, laces, silks and satins, even though she durst not wear them.
<p>Next day the rector's wife called on her and recommended a very superior boarding-house to her consideration.
<p>It was a private boarding-house, in a fashionable part of the town, kept by two maiden ladies of the most aristocratic family connections and of the highest church principles.
<p>This was exactly the home for Mrs. Grey.
<p>And the rector's wife kindly offered to take her, then and there, in the rectory carriage, to visit "the Misses Crane," the maiden ladies in question.
<p>"The Misses Crane," as they were called, dwelt in a handsomely-furnished, old-fashioned double house, standing in its own grounds, not very far from the Government House.
<p>The Misses Crane were two very tall, very thin and very fair ladies, with pale blue eyes and long, yellow, corkscrew curls each side of their wasted cheeks.
<p>They were dressed very finely in light checked summer silks, and flowing sleeves and surplice waists, with chemisettes and undersleeves of linen cambric and thread lace.
<p>They were very poor for ladies of their birth. They had nothing in the world but their handsome house, furniture and wardrobe.
<p>They depended entirely upon their boarders for their bread; yet their manners were a mixture of loftiness and condescension that had the effect of making their guests believe that they - the guests - were highly honored in being permitted to board at the Misses Cranes'.
<p>But if not highly honored they were certainly much favored, for the Misses Crane kept neat and even elegant rooms, dainty beds and an excellent table.
<p>Presented by the rector's lady, Mrs. Grey was received by the Misses Crane with a lofty politeness which overawed even her false pretensions.
<p>Presently the rector's lady, leaving Mrs. Grey to be entertained by Miss Romania Crane, took the elder Miss Crane aside and explained to her the nature of their business call.
<p>"I think she is just the kind of boarder that will suit you, as your house is just the kind of home needed by her," added the lady.
<p>Miss Crane bowed stiffly and in silence.
<p>"She is, like yourself, of an old aristocratic family, and of very high-church principles; and she has, besides, an ample income, much of which she spends for benevolent purposes," continued Mrs.  - - .
<p>Miss Crane bowed and smiled a ghastly smile, revealing her full set of false teeth.
<p>"She is, I should tell you, also entitled to all our sympathy. She has suffered a great disappointment in her affections. She was engaged to be married to the late lamented Governor of the State, when, as you know, he was suddenly struck down with apoplexy, and died a few days before the day appointed for the wedding."
<p>"Oh, indeed!" breathed Miss Crane, in a low, eager voice, losing all her stiffness and turning to glance at the interesting widowed bride elect.
<p>"Yes. And you will find her a most interesting young person - devoted to good works, one of the excellent of the earth. When she was here, two or three years ago - in the same season that she was engaged to our honored and lamented Governor - she was quite famous for her charities."
<p>"Oh, indeed!" again aspirated Miss Crane, glancing at Mrs. Grey.
<p>"I am sure that you will be mutually pleased with each other, and, as she has declared her intention to make Richmond her permanent residence, I should not wonder if she also should make your pleasant house her permanent home," added the lady.
<p>"Much honored, I'm sure," said Miss Crane, with a mixture of hauteur and complacency that was as perplexing as it was amusing.
<p>"And now, if you please, we will rejoin your sister and Mrs. Grey," said the rector's lady, rising and leading the way to the front windows, near which the other two ladies were sitting.
