<p>Sheriff Kowen looked up from his desk in amazement as the stenographer ushered in the woman. The name on her card had told him nothing, and he had expected to be confronted by some middle-aged, washed-out, tired wife and mother who would make a request to visit the jail and talk with an erring relative.
<p>What he did see when he raised his eyes and cleared his throat preparatory to indulging in his professional attitude, was a handsomely gowned, beautiful woman of perhaps thirty years, a woman who appeared to be exceedingly cultured and refined.
<p>Sheriff Kowen got out of his chair quickly, and placed one at the end of the desk for his visitor. Then he seated himself again, and looked across to her.
<p>She appeared to be nervous, almost distraught, on the verge of tears.
<p>"My dear Miss Blanchard," Sheriff Kowen said, glancing at the card the stenographer had handed to him, and for once forgetting his usual gruff manner, "is there any way in which I may be of service to you?"
<p>"I scarcely know how to approach the subject," she replied. The sheriff noticed that her voice was all that he had expected it would be - a voice that was modulated to the correct society pitch. "Such a thing as - as this is - well, I am not used to it."
<p>"Just take your time, and tell me in your own way," said the sheriff. "You have - er - some sort of a complaint to make?"
<p>"Yes, that is it. In the first place, we do not reside in this city regularly. We have a suite at a private hotel - my mother, my brother and myself. It is about my brother that I wish to see you."
<p>"He is - er - in trouble?"
<p>"Not exactly that, but - please tell me, first, Mr. Kowen, it is against the law to operate a gambling house, is it not?"
<p>"It most certainly is!" Kowen exclaimed. "When I was first elected, I fought gambling houses - got quite a reputation for working along that line. I fought the cheap ones, and I fought the pretentious dress-suit establishments - cleaned them out!"
<p>"Pardon me, Mr. Kowen, but one remains - else it is a new one that has opened recently."
<p>"What's that?" the sheriff cried, sitting up straighter in his chair. "If there is a gambling house running in my section of the country, it'll not run long!"
<p>"I - I feel almost like a spy," Miss Blanchard said. "I hate to be an informer - - "
<p>"That is your duty in such a case, my dear young lady."
<p>"I feel it so, under the circumstances," she said. "I do not want to cause my brother trouble - but I have talked it over with mother, and we decided that I should come and tell you the whole thing."
<p>"I shall be glad to listen, Miss Blanchard."
<p>"My brother is twenty-one, just a boy, you might say. When we came to the city, he happened to make the acquaintance of some other young men who belonged to a very fast set. He began remaining away from home until the early morning hours, and drinking too much, and all that."
<p>"I understand, my dear young lady. Nine young men out of ten sow their wild oats."
<p>"And he began spending more money than he could afford to spend. Mother and I began to fear he would dissipate his share of my father's estate, for he controls it since he has come of age. We wondered where the money was going - and finally we found out."
<p>"Gambling joint?"
<p>"Yes, sir. A gambling den in a large house in the most exclusive section of the city."
<p>"Those are the places I like to smash!" Sheriff Kowen told her.
<p>"I can give you the address, Mr. Kowen. I understand that a man cannot get into the place unless he is properly introduced."
<p>"Naturally, they would be very careful," the sheriff said.
<p>"It is what you called a dress-suit sort of place. Perhaps I am doing wrong telling you this - - "
<p>"Not at all. It is your duty," the sheriff assured her. "Nobody ever will know where I got my information."
<p>"I'd like to have the place closed up," Miss Blanchard continued, "so that my brother and other young men will not be robbed of their money and ruined. I suppose you would have to make a raid - I believe that is the term? I'd hate to cause my brother trouble, but a little scare might - - "
<p>"I understand, Miss Blanchard. It is probable that he would be caught in a raid, placed under arrest for frequenting a gambling resort, and brought to jail. He would immediately put up bail for his appearance in court. He would give an assumed name, and not show up in the morning, forfeiting his bail. So there would be little publicity, but he would get a scare."
<p>"Oh, thank you! If it could be done that way - - "
<p>"It can, my dear Miss Blanchard. We are determined to exterminate gambling houses. The court is in accord with me in this matter. Since you give me the information, you may be sure I'll protect your brother's interests to a certain extent. We'll frighten him a bit, but you need have no fear he will serve a term in jail, or anything like that."
<p>"I understand," said Miss Blanchard.
<p>"Simply give me the address - and then forget that you have seen and spoken to me. I'll do the rest. You must be very careful, of course, not to let your brother suspect that you have been here. He would inform his friends, and our raid would fail. Every time a raid fails, it hurts us. A certain part of the public, antagonistic politicians and newspapers, you see - - "
<p>"I understand, Mr. Kowen. Here is the address - I have written it on a card."
<p>She placed the card before him on the desk. Sheriff Kowen glanced at it.
<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed. "So! I should say it was in the most exclusive section of the city. This is very valuable information, Miss Blanchard, if our investigation bears out your statements. I cannot thank you enough. There will be more to this than a gambling-house raid; the owners of the property must give the court a little explanation, I fear."
<p>"You are sure that I did not do wrong coming here like this?"
<p>"I am sure that you did quite right, my dear young lady. You perhaps have aided us in rounding up sharpers who fleece young men of their fortunes, and perhaps you have saved your brother. He is at the stage, I take it, where a little scare will do him a lot of good. You have done quite right!"
<p>"Then I must hurry away," she said, rising. "And I shall do as you said - forget that I have been here. My brother - - "
<p>"I'll watch out for him, Miss Blanchard - a little scare and nothing more! It is the proprietor of the place and his partners we are after, more than the victims."
<p>Sheriff Kowen went as far as the corridor with Miss Blanchard, and then hurried back to his private office and began pushing buttons. He called before him certain of his deputies, gave them the information he had acquired, and certain orders, and sent them away. Then he touched match to cigar, leaned back in his chair, blew a cloud of fragrant smoke toward the ceiling, and chuckled softly. Sheriff Kowen had not had a chance to raid a gambling house of any importance for more than a year; and raiding a gambling house was his pet sport. He promised himself that this raid should be sensational in the extreme. Gambling houses were not going to flourish while Kowen was holding office as sheriff.
<p>As for Miss Blanchard, she drove in a taxicab to an exclusive private hotel, ascended in the elevator to the eighth floor, and entered a suite there.
<p>A woman of forty was sitting before a window looking down at the busy street. She was talking to a man of about the same age, a man who appeared to be a prosperous merchant, or something of the sort, and who looked up quickly when Miss Blanchard entered.
<p>"Well, Mamie, how about it?" he growled.
<p>"It was easy!" Miss Mamie Blanchard replied. "He fell for it so hard that I could almost see him bounce. He swallowed the bait, hook, sinker and line. We've played the game just right - that man would rather raid a gambling joint than eat!"
<p>"Think he'll get busy right away?" the man asked.
<p>"Busy? The instant he left me he ran back to his desk. I think that we can look for action to-night."
<p>"Well, we'll give him a chance. He'll want to make sure of the evidence first, of course, and we'll see that he gathers plenty of that without too much trouble. All the other details have been arranged. I'll issue orders this afternoon, and have everything in readiness. We can't go wrong on this."
<p>"And afterward?" the girl asked.
<p>"You'll get your reward, all right. If this man's town isn't crazy within forty-eight hours, it'll be something peculiar. You know your part, I suppose?"
<p>"Certainly."
<p>"Get ready, then. I'll go, now, and get word to all the boys. I'm glad that the long wait is over, that we are ready to strike!"
<p>The deputies sent forth by Sheriff Kowen did their work well, and without experiencing much difficulty. Their investigations were concluded before nightfall, and the sheriff rubbed his hands together in glee when he received their reports.
<p>At eleven o'clock that night, he sat at his desk and answered telephone calls. At a certain place near the gambling house his men had gathered. Kowen knew from experience that it did not do to have them meet at his office or the county jail. There always was somebody watching, and any unusual activity would cause a warning to be flashed to every resort that had reason to expect a raid.
<p>"It's all right, boss," one of his deputies telephoned. "We've been on the watch since eight o'clock. There are about thirty men in the place now, and more coming all the time. They're pretty bold about it - feel safe, I reckon."
<p>"That's because they've been getting away with it for a few months," the sheriff replied. "We'll make 'em sick before morning."
<p>He finished smoking his cigar; then left the office and walked down the street to the corner, as he always did at that hour of the night. That was to make things appear natural, if anybody happened to be watching. He waited for a surface car, got aboard, and started home. At a certain corner, he alighted in order to transfer to another line.
<p>But Sheriff Kowen did not use his transfer to-night. He made sure that nobody was watching him, and then darted down a side street. He pulled his hat over his eyes, bent his shoulders forward, and walked rapidly down the broad avenue toward the exclusive residential section of the city.
<p>He had a mile to walk. He covered three fourths of it at a good pace, and then slowed down and became more alert. He passed another man on a corner.
<p>"All right, boss," the man whispered.
<p>"All right!" Sheriff Kowen answered.
<p>Kowen went on up the street. He stopped in a dark spot beneath an overhanging tree, and looked at a house in the middle of the block. He knew the property; it belonged to an old estate, and was handled by a well-known real estate firm. For years it had been without a tenant. The investigation made by the deputies during the afternoon had resulted in the information that it had been repaired and leased some three months before to strangers in the city, but people who had exhibited good references.
<p>It was some distance away from the other residences, and the lot was bordered by a high hedge, except in front. It was an ideal location for a fashionable gambling resort.
<p>As Kowen watched, he saw a young man saunter down the street, hesitate a moment, then enter the gate and hurry toward the house.
<p>"Another victim!" Kowen told himself.
<p>Now one of his deputies approached him, keeping in the shadows as much as possible.
<p>"Well?" Kowen snapped.
<p>"Almost forty men in there, boss," the deputy reported.
<p>"All our crowd ready?"
<p>"Yes."
<p>"What time is it?"
<p>"Quarter after twelve. I looked at my watch as I walked under the light at the corner."
<p>"Let's get in action then," Kowen said. "I don't want any slips, now. I want to gather in the whole lot. Got the autos ready?"
<p>"They're ready, boss, waiting down the street a couple of blocks."
<p>"Signal them up, and we'll begin."
<p>The deputy hurried away. Sheriff Kowen crossed the street, turned in through the gate, and blew a whistle.
<p>On every side, deputies rushed toward the house, surrounding it immediately. Kowen ran up the steps and knocked at the door. An aperture was opened, a face peered out, there was an exclamation, and the aperture was closed again.
<p>"Into it!" Kowen cried.
<p>Deputies ran forward with axes and attacked the heavy door. The door at the rear was attacked in the same manner. Some of the men guarded the entrance to the basement, others watched the windows closely.
<p>The front door crashed down, and the officers poured into the house. From the second floor came a chorus of cries and shrieks. The lights had been extinguished, and electric torches flashed.
<p>"Watch those stairs!" Kowen cried. "Some of you clean out the basement - I want the entire crowd! I'll go above!"
<p>They made their way to the head of the stairs, smashed through another door, flashed their torches, found the light switch and turned it. The big room was bathed in light.
<p>Sheriff Kowen smiled grimly as he surveyed the scene. He saw faro and roulette layouts, poker tables, almost every gambling device known. Some two score of men in evening dress were crouching against the walls. A glance was enough to tell the sheriff the customers and the dealers. He slapped his hands together.
<p>"Round 'em up!" he ordered.
<p>His deputies sprang to obey. One by one, the men in the room were manacled, despite their protests. When Sheriff Kowen raided a gambling house, he did not do things by halves.
<p>A crowd had collected in the street by now. The automobiles Kowen had ordered were before the house, ready to receive their loads of prisoners. Kowen received reports from deputies who had searched the place from cellar to garret. He detailed men to guard the house and the gambling apparatus it contained, and then the parade began.
<p>The parade was always a big moment with Kowen. He stood at the curb and watched the prisoners pass him and go to the automobiles. He enjoyed the looks of wrath, of fear in the faces of these callow youths. Some of them he knew, but a very few. For the most part, the prisoners seemed to be strangers to him, but that did not bother Kowen. The city was a large one; a new crop of victims appeared every week, the sheriff knew.
<p>The prisoners were driven to the county jail and taken into the office. Kowen informed them as to the charges, and announced that bail would be one hundred dollars in each case, except that of the proprietor of the place. The jailer and bookkeeper got ready.
<p>It was then that Sheriff Kowen got his first surprise. With the exception of the proprietor, none of his prisoners would furnish bail. The arrest was an outrage, they declared. They had been informed that the ordinance against gambling was unconstitutional. They were going to jail, going to fight the case, and then sue for damages. They'd show Sheriff Kowen and his men that citizens had rights that should be respected.
<p>"Are you a bunch of lunatics?" Kowen cried. "Don't you worry about that gambling law - we've convicted many a man on it, men who had coin to fight their cases, too. And let me tell you men something - if you go into cells, your right names go down on the blotter. They'll go into the newspapers, too; and the people of this city will know just who the men are who smash laws and waste money!"
<p>"We're not worrying any about that stuff!" one of the prisoners told him.
<p>"Then you'll be searched and slammed into cells, believe me! And you'll be treated like ordinary prisoners. I have a faint idea that you'll be dead willing to put up bail by noon. These cells of mine are not comfortable suites. And you'll miss your baths and grapefruit in the morning, and your thin toast! Well?"
<p>None made reply. Kowen glanced around the room at them, and then an angry flush came into his face. He had half a dozen deputies there, and the night jailer and the bookkeeper. He had let the other deputies go, thinking this would be like other raids, that the prisoners would put up bail immediately or telephone for it, and hurry to their homes.
<p>"Line up against that wall!" he commanded. "If you are so eager to go to jail, we can accommodate you, all right. The jailer will search you."
<p>The jailer appeared before the first man, who started taking things from his pockets. Sheriff Kowen turned his back and started for his private office in disgust. Newspapermen were waiting there for him, and the sheriff did not dislike publicity.
<p>Then something strange happened!
<p>With the exceptions of the few men known to the sheriff, every prisoner drew something from his pocket. Something seemed to crash against the floor. There was a series of sharp explosions, and the office and rooms adjoining were filled with clouds of white, pungent smoke.
<p>The jailer opened his mouth to shout a warning, and toppled over on the floor without having spoken. Here and there the deputies were dropping, none of them having time to get out a revolver and fire a shot. Sheriff Kowen rushed in from his private office to have a cloud of the pungent vapor strike him full in the face. The newspaper reporters suffered a like fate.
<p>The prisoners were holding tiny sponges to their nostrils, and now they sprang into action. Some rushed to the street door and locked and barred it. Others drew the shades at the windows. One searched the jailer and got his keys, and hurried toward the door leading into the corridor.
<p>This door was opened. Four of the prisoners rushed down the aisle and came to a certain cell. Inside it a man was sitting on a bunk.
<p>"Good work!" he exclaimed.
<p>The door of the cell was unlocked, and the man stepped out. He led the way back to the office, glanced around it quickly.
<p>"Everything done?" he asked.
<p>"Everything done, sir," one of the men replied.
<p>"Let's go, then!"
<p>The street door was unlocked. Around the corner came half a dozen automobiles. They were filled, and darted away, scattering as they came to the first street corner.
<p>Sheriff Kowen groaned and opened his eyes. One of his deputies was just regaining consciousness. The sheriff tried to get to his feet.
<p>"What - what - - " he began.
<p>"They're all gone - jail door's open," the deputy gasped.
<p>"It - - I know! Vapor bombs!" Kowen cried. "More Black Star work! Quick - look - - "
<p>Kowen had managed to get to his feet now, and was rushing into the corridor of the jail. More deputies were regaining consciousness. The sheriff pushed past them and ran down the corridor. They heard him cry out.
<p>"Gone - gone!" he shrieked. "The Black Star has escaped! It was all a trick - that woman, the gambling joint - a trick to get all those men in here so they could do their work - - "
<p>"Here's a note in the cell!" a deputy cried.
<p>The sheriff took it and ran back to the office. One of the deputies already was telephoning police headquarters and relating the story. The Black Star had been rescued! The supercriminal who had been tried and convicted, who was to start for the State prison on the following day, had made his escape!
<p>On the brow of each unconscious man left behind by the band there had been pasted a tiny black star - the criminal's mark. There was a row of them on the blotter-sheet. They were on the walls, on the casements.
<p>The reporters rushed for telephones. Here was news that would startle the city in the morning. Was the town in for another reign of crime? Would the notorious Black Star merely make good his escape, or did he have plans perfected? Was his band reorganized? Would he take vengeance for his arrest and incarceration?
<p>The note found in the cell supplied the answer. Sheriff Kowen read it quickly:
<p>To Whom It May Concern:
<p>Did you think for an instant that the Black Star would go to prison to serve twenty years? It was a very clever rescue, was it not? And for the months I have been held in jail, for the strain and worry of my trial, I am going to make the city pay. My organization is more perfect than before. My plans have been well made. The city shall pay - pay - pay! And tell that fool of a Roger Verbeck, who was instrumental in catching me before, that he will be helpless this time. I defy him even to find the location of my headquarters.
<p>All the telephones were busy now. The pungent odor that had come from the vapor bombs had blown out of the room. Word was being flashed over the city that the Black Star had been rescued by his band, and that he had promised a wave of crime to pay for his incarceration.
<p>Nobody doubted that such would be the case. The city knew well that the Black Star always made good his boasts. Nobody doubted that his organization was greater than it had been before, and that clever plans had been made.
<p>The Black Star, they had reason to suppose, would not wait very long before striking, for that was not his nature. The city faced the great question:
<p>Where would the Black Star strike first?
<p>Roger Verbeck was the last of his family, a man who moved in the best social circles, who had wealth and good looks and friends, and an athletic body.
<p>It had been Roger Verbeck who had put the Black Star behind prison bars. When the supercriminal first began his work in the city, the police seemed to be unable to do anything against him. Verbeck had made a boast at a reception one night that he could capture the Black Star himself. That boast had led to many adventures.
<p>One of the Black Star's band happened to overhear the boast, for the men and women working for the Black Star were to be found in all walks of life, and there was nothing strange in the fact that one of them happened to be a guest at an exclusive social affair. At one stage of the game even Verbeck himself had been suspected of being a lieutenant of the master criminal.
<p>The Black Star had challenged Verbeck to make good his boast, and there had ensued a duel of wits. Whereas the master rogue had an organization at his command, Verbeck had nobody except Muggs.
<p>Muggs was a peculiar individual. Years before, Muggs had stood on a bridge over the Seine, in Paris, ready to fling himself into the water and end an existence that, in a fit of despondency, he had decided was not worth carrying out to its logical conclusion.
<p>Roger Verbeck had grasped him by the arm in time to save him, and had convinced Muggs that life was worth the living. So Muggs became attached to Roger Verbeck. He was known as Verbeck's valet, but he was a comrade-in-arms in reality. He shared Verbeck's adventures, and often turned failure into success. He was ready to fight for Verbeck at any moment.
<p>Muggs had worked with Verbeck against the Black Star, and when the master criminal finally was captured and incarcerated, Muggs had turned valet again. But Muggs was a man who demanded action, and time hung heavy on his hands. For Roger Verbeck was thinking of getting married, and he had small time for adventuring.
<p>Muggs was a small man, but one of great strength. There was nothing handsome about him. Some called him repulsive, but not in Roger Verbeck's hearing.
<p>Muggs had been a criminal and knew the ways of criminals. He had been of great value to Verbeck on numerous occasions, and once had saved his life. Between them they possessed nearly all human qualifications, and they made an excellent team.
<p>On the night of the rescue of the Black Star, Roger Verbeck had called upon his fiancée. He returned to his rooms shortly after the hour of twelve, and immediately went to bed, Muggs retiring a few minutes later. There was to be a golf tournament the following day, and Verbeck was a contestant.
<p>Both men were asleep almost immediately. Most of the tenants in the big apartment house had retired. In the office on the ground floor a sleepy clerk was attempting to keep his eyes open and read a magazine. The night telephone operator had gone to a restaurant a couple of blocks away for a midnight cup of coffee, and the sleepy clerk was watching the switchboard.
<p>There entered a gentleman from the street - a man whose face was muffled in his coat collar. He was well-dressed, very much the gentleman, and the clerk got up and hurried to the desk. Somebody with an important business message for one of the tenants, the clerk supposed.
<p>"Something I can do for you, sir?" the clerk asked.
<p>"Yes - go to sleep!" came the reply.
<p>The visitor drew a vapor gun and discharged it in the clerk's face. The latter gasped, and sank to the floor. The one who had used the gun stepped to the door and gave a signal. Three more men sprang from a closed car standing at the curb, and hurried into the lobby of the house.
<p>"Telephone operator be back in a few minutes," the first man said. "One of you remain here and get him. Answer any calls on the switchboard, so things will look natural."
<p>One remained; the other three ran quickly up the stairs, ignoring the elevator, which was in the basement, with a sleepy operator hoping that nobody would call him.
<p>The three made their way to the floor where Roger Verbeck had his suite. They listened outside Verbeck's door; then one of them inserted a skeleton key, pushed out the key on the inside, turned the lock and opened the door half a dozen inches.
<p>Again they listened, then opened the door wider and slipped inside. It was evident that they were well acquainted with the place. While one of them remained in the big living room, another went to the door of Verbeck's bedchamber, and a third to the door of the room used by Muggs.
<p>There came a sharp hiss. The doors were opened. Figures darted across rooms. Two vapor guns were discharged, and Roger Verbeck and Muggs were instantly rendered unconscious as they slept.
<p>"Easy work!" one of the men commented. "Get busy, now!"
<p>Muggs was gagged and bound and lashed to the bed. Roger Verbeck was dressed quickly by two of the men, while the third remained in the living room, listening. When Verbeck had been made ready, the man in the living room slipped into the hall, saw that nobody was there and that the elevator was still in the basement. He returned and gave a signal, and the other two picked up Verbeck and carried him into the hall.
<p>They went down the stairs, flight by flight, meeting nobody, and finally came to the office again, where the fourth man was waiting. The telephone operator had returned and had been rendered unconscious by means of a vapor gun.
<p>They carried Verbeck to the automobile, put him in it, got in themselves, and the machine darted away. Verbeck groaned, and once more a vapor gun was discharged in his face. He relaxed.
<p>"That'll do him until we get to headquarters," one of the men said. "We don't want him sick, and that stuff is pretty strong. What do you suppose the boss is going to do with him?"
<p>"It is an excellent plan not to go supposing what the boss is going to do with anybody," another growled. "I was in the other gang, and I happen to know that it's a good thing to let the boss attend to his own affairs."
<p>"Well, I didn't mean anything," snarled the other.
<p>The automobile traveled across the city, and after a time reached a large house that sat far back on a quiet lane. Here the car left the main thoroughfare, turned into the lane, and presently stopped before the veranda of the house. Roger Verbeck was carried inside. The automobile was driven around to the rear, and all its lights extinguished immediately.
<p>When Verbeck regained consciousness he was bewildered. He was in a room that was brilliantly lighted. He was stretched upon a couch, fully dressed. He could not comprehend it at all.
<p>He sat up and looked around the room. It was lavishly furnished, and in excellent taste. In the middle of the room was a long table, and there were a score of heavy chairs scattered about. There were two doors, one at either end of the room, but there did not seem to be any windows. Here and there tapestries hung on the walls.
<p>He heard a bell tinkle, and one of the doors opened. There entered two men, both wearing long black robes, and black masks.
<p>Verbeck knew, then. He had seen the costume of the members of the Black Star's band often before. He had even worn one once, while gathering evidence for use against the master criminal.
<p>So he had been abducted by the Black Star's men, and he had supposed that they were so scattered that they could make no move. Was he to be held as hostage, or something like that? Verbeck knew that the Black Star was to be taken to prison within twenty-four hours. Were these men going to avenge themselves upon him because he had been instrumental in sending their leader to prison?
<p>"Well?" Verbeck growled.
<p>Neither man answered him, but he really had not expected that. The members of the Black Star's band did not talk much. One of the men went to the side of the room, and threw back one of the tapestries, revealing a small blackboard.
<p>Why, this was exactly like the old headquarters of the Black Star, for they had conversed there by means of blackboards! Could it be possible that the band had gathered again, and were going to continue their nefarious work without their leader, the master mind that had guided and controlled them before?
<p>Verbeck watched as the man wrote:
<p>"Mr. Verbeck will remain quietly on the couch for the time being. If he does not, he shall be made unconscious again."
<p>"What is the idea?" Verbeck asked.
<p>"One is coming who wishes to hold a conversation with you," the man wrote on the blackboard.
<p>"How long shall I have to wait?" Verbeck demanded.
<p>"Until he comes!" the other wrote, and then dropped the tapestry and went to stand beside his companion before the door.
<p>Verbeck sat down on the couch again and regarded them. He felt in his pocket, found cigarettes and matches, and started smoking. His brain was not entirely clear yet.
<p>He wondered what the man had meant. Who was the person for whom he was waiting? Of course, it couldn't be the Black Star, Verbeck told himself. The Black Star was to go to prison the following day, to begin serving his sentence of twenty years. He had lost his last appeal. He had been a broken man, evidently, for the past two or three months had acted like one who had given up all hope of escape.
<p>Verbeck smoked the cigarette and lighted another. Again a bell tinkled in the distance. Again the door was opened. Roger Verbeck gasped.
<p>The robed and masked figure that entered was larger than the other men; and on the front of the hood that enveloped his head was a big, flaming black star of jet.
<p>The Black Star!
<p>Then Verbeck chuckled. He saw it now, of course. The band had elected another leader, and he had assumed the garb of the Black Star. Probably they expected to punish Roger Verbeck for what he had done.
<p>The man who wore the star advanced to the middle of the room. One hand came from beneath his robe, and Verbeck saw that he held a vapor gun in it. He made a motion, and the other two men left the room and closed the door.
<p>"So we have a new Black Star, have we?" Verbeck said.
<p>The man before him laughed, then took off his mask and tossed it aside.
<p>"Not a new one! The same one!" he said.
<p>Verbeck gave a cry and sprang from the couch. There could be no mistake. The notorious master rogue stood before him. Verbeck knew his face well enough.
<p>"But - - " he began.
<p>"My friends rescued me during the night," the Black Star said. "It was a very pretty little plot, indeed. I may as well let you know that I am heading my organization again. My people have been collected by a lieutenant of mine who never ceased working while I was in your county jail. My band is stronger than it was before, and we are going to make the city pay."
<p>"Well, what about me?" Verbeck asked.
<p>"I have had you brought here to show you in what contempt I hold you," the master criminal said. "You caught me before, but you'll not catch me again! Here is my new headquarters - take a good look. I suppose you'll be on my trail again?"
<p>"And I'll catch you again!" Verbeck cried.
<p>"It will be a pleasure to have you try, Mr. Verbeck. It adds spice to the game to have a good foe - and I'll admit that you are a good foe. It will be entertaining to outwit you continually, to make you the laughingstock of the city."
<p>"You tried that once before, and I had the last laugh!"
<p>"Pardon me! It is not time for the last laugh yet - but when the time does come, I shall have it!"
<p>"Well, what are you going to do with me?" Verbeck demanded.
<p>"My dear Mr. Verbeck! Did you imagine you were to be treated with violence? You know that I abhor violence of all kinds. I merely had you brought here so that we could have this little conversation. I shall send a letter to the newspapers telling them how I had you here and let you see my new headquarters. That will give the city its first laugh at you."
<p>"If I get the chance, I'll catch you!" Verbeck declared.
<p>"I intend you shall have the chance, my dear Mr. Verbeck. I shall render you unconscious again, and have you taken to a certain place in the city and left there. When you regain consciousness, start on my trail, if you can find it. You were unconscious when you came here, and will be when you depart. You understand? And I don't mind telling you, Roger Verbeck, that anything done by me and my band before my arrest was insignificant compared to what we intend doing now. I shall strike within twenty-four hours, Mr. Verbeck. You need not trouble to warn the city. I already have sent letters to the papers telling them of my intention."
<p>"And you can't get away with it!" Verbeck exclaimed. "I'll hunt you down - - "
<p>"That is your privilege, Mr. Verbeck," the Black Star interrupted. "I flatter myself that I am a sportsman. I have you in my power at the present moment, and could keep you where you could cause me no trouble or annoyance. But I'd rather have you free to use your wits against mine. As I remarked before, it will add spice to the game. Heaven knows that the police couldn't even make it interesting for me!"
<p>"So you are going to stagger the city, are you?" Verbeck asked.
<p>"I am, Mr. Verbeck. We are going to loot the city more thoroughly than we did before. We have perfected certain plans, and shall strike soon."
<p>"Going to play your old game - going to let us know in advance what you are going to do?"
<p>"Possibly - at times," said the Black Star, smiling. "And I feel sure that this time there will be no little accident that will make it possible for you to take me into custody. By the way, how is your man, Muggs?"
<p>"In excellent condition," Verbeck said.
<p>"My compliments to him, when you see him again, and tell him for me that it will be a pleasure to clash with him. In a way, I admire Muggs. He is such a perfect type of a thug."
<p>"He is not the man to have for an enemy."
<p>"Bah! I could outwit a score of men like Muggs without calling any of my organization to my aid. Well, Mr. Verbeck, I am afraid that we shall have to terminate this interesting conversation. I must get a little rest, and confer with some of my people."
<p>He stepped back to the wall and pressed a button. Immediately the door opened, and the two robed and masked men entered the room. One of them held a vapor gun in his hand.
<p>Roger Verbeck was well aware that it would be a losing fight, yet he fought to his utmost. But the fumes were discharged, the pungent odor struck into his nostrils and filled his lungs, he was forced to gasp for breath - and unconsciousness claimed him.
<p>The last thing he heard was the sarcastic laughter of the Black Star!
<p>The chief of police, notified by Sheriff Kowen that the Black Star had been rescued cleverly by members of his band, dressed quickly and hurried to police headquarters, there to go into his private office and rave and fume, and relate to the world that Sheriff Kowen was an official who knew not the meaning of precaution and efficiency.
<p>"That's what he gets for being a bug on raiding gambling joints!" the chief cried. "Anybody would have known it was a plant - anybody with brains. We fight that fiend of a Black Star for more than a year, Roger Verbeck finally lands him, we convict the brute and have him handed a stiff sentence - and then an idiotic sheriff allows him to escape! Now I suppose we are in for another reign of terror, with every newspaper in town telling the dear public that the police are fit candidates for some old lady's home!"
<p>There was a lot more of this, while captains and lieutenants, sergeants and roundsmen held their peace and hoped that their superior would not make this an occasion for reprimanding them for some fancied mistake. The chief had worked his way up from the ranks; he was endowed with more brute force than intelligence, and he was a bad man when aroused.
<p>"Call Roger Verbeck's apartment, and get him on the wire!" the chief commanded.
<p>The desk sergeant tried it immediately. He reported that the apartment house did not answer. The chief made a few remarks about sleeping telephone operators, and ordered the desk sergeant to try again. Not getting a reply immediately, the chief called two detectives, ordered them to hurry to Verbeck's place and acquaint him with the news, and to have Verbeck get in communication with the chief at once.
<p>"The first thing the Black Star will do, will be to get hold of Verbeck!" the chief declared. "He'll probably put Verbeck out of the way if we don't prevent it. Verbeck caught him before, and he'll have to do it again. I've got a police force composed of idiots, imbeciles and blockheads! They couldn't catch a turtle walking across the street!"
<p>At about the same moment the chief of police was indulging in this tirade, Muggs groaned, tried to turn over and found that he could not, experienced nausea, wondered whether he was being taken down with some disease - and then made the discovery that he was bound and gagged and lashed to the bed.
<p>Having made that discovery, Muggs forced himself to breathe normally, composed himself, and tried to think. The last he remembered, he had retired, started to fall asleep, and had dropped into the middle of a not unpleasant dream. Now it appeared that there had been violence, and he had known nothing of it.
<p>"Burglars!" Muggs thought at first. "Doped while I slept, and tied up like this! I wonder if the boss - - "
<p>The mere thought that something disastrous might have happened to Roger Verbeck moved Muggs to instant action. He struggled with his bonds, and at first believed that they could not be slipped; but finally he found a knot that gave a trifle, and he redoubled his efforts, working in a frenzy, his imagination picturing Roger Verbeck robbed and slain.
<p>After a time the knot gave, and Muggs managed to get his hands free. He removed the gag and started working at the cords about his ankles.
<p>"Boss! Boss!" he called.
<p>There came no answer from Verbeck's room. Muggs managed to get off the last rope, and sprang from the bed. Immediately he reeled and fell back again.
<p>"I'm - sick!" Muggs gasped weakly. "That was - some dope! I wonder what it - - "
<p>And then it came to him.
<p>"I know that feelin' in my head and that taste in my mouth!" he told himself. "Vapor gun! I've had enough doses of it before to know! The - the Black Star - - "
<p>But the Black Star was safe in a cell in the county jail, and due to be taken to the penitentiary in a few hours, Muggs tried to tell himself. However, Muggs did not have a lot of faith in jails, having escaped from them twice himself before Roger Verbeck saved his life and made a man of him.
<p>Once more he started to get up from the bed, this time slowly and cautiously. He did not experience the nausea now, and though he still felt weak, yet he managed to stagger across the room toward the door.
<p>He went into Verbeck's bedchamber and snapped on the lights. Verbeck was not there. The room was in confusion. Verbeck's clothes, that Muggs had put out for use in the morning, were gone, and his pajamas were on the floor in a corner.
<p>Muggs hurried to the bed. It was there, pasted on the headpiece - a tiny black star!
<p>"If he hurt my boss - - " Muggs began, almost sobbing.
<p>And then he felt moved to sudden action again. He rushed into the living room and to the telephone. He rattled the hook frantically, and presently heard the operator's reply.
<p>"I want the police!" Muggs cried into the transmitter. "Mr. Verbeck is gone - been taken away!"
<p>"Say! There are a couple of detectives here now to see Mr. Verbeck," the operator replied. "They're coming right up!"
<p>Muggs darted back into his own room and began dressing with such speed that he was almost fully clothed when the officers knocked at the door. Muggs hurried to let them in.
<p>"What's this about Mr. Verbeck?" one of them asked.
<p>"The Black Star's got him!" Muggs cried. "They doped us while we slept, and - - "
<p>"I guess I can tell you all about that," the detective interrupted. "They put out the night clerk and the telephone operator with those cursed vapor guns."
<p>"And Mr. Verbeck is gone! They must have taken him! We've got to find him! There's a black star - pasted on his bed - - "
<p>"The chief just sent us up to see Verbeck about this business. The Black Star's gang rescued their leader to-night - turned him loose. He left a note saying that he was going to raid the town."
<p>"Well, why stand here and gas about it?" Muggs demanded. "Don't you understand that the Black Star's got my boss? He put the big crook in jail before, and you can probably guess what he'll get handed to him for it now, if the Black Star is loose!"
<p>"Well, what can we do?" one of the detectives asked. "All we found out was that there was a closed auto out in front, and three or four men with it. If they carried Verbeck away, it's a wild guess where they took him. This town has some size, remember, and the Black Star and his gang are smooth customers."
<p>"You're a fine lot of detectives!" Muggs sneered. "You don't know what to do, huh? Expect to find him by standin' around here smokin' cheap cigars? Why don't you talk to headquarters and tell what you know? Get busy!"
<p>One of the detectives called the station and made his report to the chief. The police reporters were electrified by the statement that Roger Verbeck had been abducted by members of the master crook's organization. At the time the Black Star was arrested, he had sworn to have vengeance on Verbeck, and though he claimed that he abhorred violence, and seldom resorted to it, there were fears and misgivings lest Verbeck's body be found in some lonely spot, a black star pasted on the forehead.
<p>The chief had not been idle. Every officer in the city was alert. The police knew that the master criminal must have a headquarters somewhere, and that it was their duty to locate it. Until he was under arrest again, and his band broken up, he was a constant menace. He was liable to strike at any part of the city, at any moment of day or night. The blow might fall upon one of the big banks, or upon some social gathering where a fortune in jewels could be obtained.
<p>News of Verbeck's abduction was flashed to all officers as soon as possible. Roads leading from the city were under guard, and all vehicles were being stopped and their occupants questioned. Arrangements had been made to quiz real estate and rental firms in the morning, ascertain every recent lease, and investigate it. The chief had given out word that the headquarters of the master criminal had to be found, and without delay.
<p>Muggs journeyed to headquarters with the two detectives, and told all that he knew. And then he paced the chief's private office, raging, begging them to do something, to give him only as much as a clew regarding where Roger Verbeck had been taken, and he, Muggs, would rescue him alone.
<p>In vain the chief attempted to quiet Muggs.
<p>"He's my boss - he ain't yours!" Muggs shrieked. "He saved my life and he showed me how to make a man of myself! Maybe you don't care what becomes of him, but I do. And if that big crook harms him, I'll get Mr. Black Star if it takes me the rest of my life, and I'll choke the life out of him with my bare hands!"
<p>"Muggs, we're doing all that we can!" the chief protested.
<p>"What are you doin'? Yellin' over the telephone to a bunch of cops and havin' them run around in circles?"
<p>"But we can't do anything else!" the chief cried. "All we can do is - - "
<p>The bell of his telephone rang. The chief whirled around and took down the receiver.
<p>"Hello!" he cried.
<p>"Hello!" a man's voice answered. "Well, well, it is some time since I had the pleasure of speaking to you over a telephone wire, chief."
<p>"Who is this?" the chief cried. "We're pretty busy here to-night, and - - "
<p>"I suppose that is all my fault. Don't you recognize my voice? I am the Black Star!"
<p>"Oh, are you?" the chief shouted. "Well, you put one over on Sheriff Kowen, but we'll pick you up before long!"
<p>"You think so?" the Black Star asked, laughing.
<p>"I know it, you crook! We'll get you, and we'll get the men and women of that gang of yours!"
<p>"Well, well! You are talking violently, chief - but you always were inclined to violence."
<p>"I'll be violent enough when I get my hands on you, all right!"
<p>"And I just called you up to give you some information. Are you concerned about Roger Verbeck? One of my men reported a few minutes ago that you were. You see, I am keeping in touch with you, chief. I know every order you issue, every plan you make."
<p>"What about Verbeck?"
<p>"Don't worry about him. I had him taken to my headquarters so I could have a little conversation with him. Half an hour ago he was dropped, drugged, and unconscious, at the edge of one of the city parks. No doubt he will be with you soon."
<p>"Your headquarters, huh?" the chief cried. "We'll locate that little place within twenty-four hours, if it is in the city!"
<p>"You think so? I assure you that it is in the city - and perhaps in a quarter where you'd least expect to find it. I scarcely think you can find it inside twenty-four hours, chief. Besides, you are going to be very busy before then."
<p>"I am, eh?"
<p>"You are," the Black Star said. "You will be wondering how we did it."
<p>"Did what?"
<p>"What it is that we are going to do - the first blow, chief!"
<p>"Lost your nerve, have you? You used to tell us what you were going to do, and dare us to catch you at it."
<p>"Chief, your work is too coarse. Trying to anger me into telling you my plans, are you? It cannot be done to-night, chief. But I'll tell you this much - we intend making quite a haul! Expenses have been heavy recently, you know, and I must have a sort of indemnity."
<p>"You'll get something worse than that when we get our hands on you!" the exasperated chief cried. "You'll go up for life when we catch you!"
<p>"Catch me first!" the Black Star suggested. "By the way, some of my men left Muggs bound and gagged when they carried Verbeck away. You should see that he is released."
<p>"He has been - he's here."
<p>Muggs thrust the chief aside and grasped the receiver.
<p>"Yes, he's here, you big crook!" Muggs cried. "He'll be on hand when you're caught, too, and then you want to look out for yourself! Kidnap my boss, will you?"
<p>"Why, Muggs, how violent you are!"
<p>"You - you - - " Muggs sputtered. "When I get hold of you, I'll make you think you never saw or heard tell of that violence stuff before! I'll show you some real violence, you crook!"
<p>"Tut, tut, Muggs! You'll be working yourself into a passion, my dear boy. By the way, Muggs, tell the chief that he need not bother about tracing this telephone call. I have tapped a private wire and am talking over it - understand?"
<p>A click came over the wire, and it went dead. Muggs put up the receiver and turned away from the desk, growling.
<p>The door of the office was thrown open - and Roger Verbeck hurried in.
<p>"Boss! Boss!" Muggs cried.
<p>"One minute, Muggs! We haven't time for a demonstration of affection at present. Well, chief, he had me nabbed, and I've seen the inside of his new headquarters."
<p>"Know where they are?"
<p>"I haven't the slightest idea. I was in an inside room - unconscious when taken there, and unconscious when they brought me away. I came back to life up in the park, where they had dropped me, got a taxi and hurried here. I suppose we have it all to do over again. We've got to catch that fiend, of course!"
<p>"Will you help, Verbeck?" the chief cried. "Will you take the time and trouble?"
<p>"You know it! Why, the Black Star challenged me again - said I couldn't catch him."
<p>"You're in command, Verbeck, as you were the other time. Any orders now? Where shall we start in?"
<p>"You're having the roads watched?"
<p>"Of course."
<p>"Throw out the dragnet and pick up what you can. Can't tell - might get a clew of some sort, you know. Get the rental agencies - - "
<p>"I've planned to do that."
<p>"It probably will do no good, but it won't hurt any to try. The Black Star is too smooth to be caught in that way. His headquarters probably is in some house one of his band has owned and occupied for years."
<p>"He just called up," Muggs put in. "He said we'd be busy within twenty-four hours."
<p>"And the Black Star, as we know well, always keeps his word!" Roger Verbeck declared. "So his message probably means that he will strike his first blow to-morrow night - or, rather, to-night. But where? And what? Those are the questions."
<p>"And all we can do - - " the chief began.
<p>"Is to wait until he strikes, and then take up the trail," Roger Verbeck added. "I found out one thing - he has some new people in his organization. He is using the blackboards again."
<p>"What's that?" the chief asked.
<p>"Each member of the band has a number and a countersign. Each enters the headquarters room robed and masked, and carries on the conversation by means of the blackboards. The Black Star issues his orders the same way. He handles them by number, and in his other organization the numbers were issued by one of his lieutenants."
<p>"What's the use of all that?" the chief asked.
<p>"It is very simple, chief. The Black Star may know what Number Eight or Number Ten does, but he doesn't know the identities of the persons with those numbers. He never could go on the witness stand and swear that a certain member of his band did a certain share of the work. Understand? It is a protection all around. On the other hand, the men could not swear that the Black Star issued the orders - it might be somebody else wearing the master crook's robe and mask. See?"
<p>"He's a clever devil!" the chief grunted.
<p>"He is!" Verbeck agreed. "We discovered that much before, remember. But we know his methods now, and that is a help. We will not make the mistake of underestimating him. It's all right to let him think so, and to talk like it when he calls up by telephone, but in truth we know we're up against a tough proposition, and we've got to act accordingly."
<p>"You mean to say you think it's going to be a hard job landing him?" the chief asked.
<p>"I mean just that," said Roger Verbeck. "But we'll get him!"
<p>"You can bet we will!" added Mr. Muggs.
<p>The morning newspapers had some very uncomplimentary things to say, both in the news columns and on the editorial page, concerning Sheriff Kowen.
<p>The sheriff, who had had less than three hours' sleep, raged when he read, and tore the papers into shreds.
<p>"That's right - blame me!" he shrieked. "Blame a man who was trying to do his duty! If I don't raid gambling houses, I get blamed, and if I do raid 'em, I get blamed again. How did I know that place was a plant? It was a gambling house, wasn't it?"
<p>Since the sheriff was a bachelor, there was nobody in his apartment to enjoy this tirade. He went to his favorite restaurant for breakfast, and sat at a table far back in one corner, refusing to hold conversation with anybody who approached.
<p>The sheriff was gathering anger. He did not intend to let Roger Verbeck and the police get all the credit when the master crook was caught again. He would go after the Black Star himself, he decided - swear in more deputies and call upon his men to win. There were certain political reasons for this. Moreover, the sheriff was a conscientious man; since the Black Star had escaped through his work, it was his duty, he felt, to recapture him.
<p>Sheriff Kowen left the restaurant and walked toward the county jail, where he maintained his office. He passed countless persons he knew, both men and women, and saw many smiles that possessed a quality the sheriff did not relish. But he refused to take a taxicab - he would show the public that he was not in hiding!
<p>"If I ever meet that Blanchard woman again - - " the sheriff told himself; and just then he saw her.
<p>She was on the walk a few feet ahead of him, going slowly toward a department store. Sheriff Kowen hurried up to her, touched her on the arm.
<p>"I want to talk to you!" he said gruffly.
<p>"Oh, good morning, sheriff!" she said, and smiled.
<p>The sheriff was disconcerted for an instant, but composure returned to him quickly.
<p>"We are only a block from the jail, and my office," he said. "I want to talk to you there. Shall we walk, or shall I call a cab and charge it to the county?"
<p>There was a certain meaning to the last sentence, but she did not seem to realize it.
<p>"I should be charmed to talk to you," she said, "but I have some shopping to do this morning."
<p>"Your shopping will have to wait, young woman. This is a serious business."
<p>"Why, what can you mean?" she asked.
<p>"Either you walk along with me to my office, or you go as a prisoner!"
<p>"Are you insane? Arrest me?"
<p>"In a minute!" said Sheriff Kowen.
<p>"I - I don't understand this - but I'll go along with you," said Mamie Blanchard.
<p>"I thought you would," the sheriff returned.
<p>He said nothing more as they walked down the street. He took her into his private office and offered her a chair at one end of his desk. He closed the door, telling the stenographer that he was not to be disturbed for the present.
<p>"Now kindly tell me the meaning of this," said Mamie Blanchard. "I - you almost frightened me!"
<p>"What do you know about the Black Star?" Kowen asked.
<p>"Why, I read this morning that he escaped from your jail last night. You should be more careful."
<p>Sheriff Kowen's face turned purple with wrath, but he controlled himself and bent toward her across the desk.
<p>"And the cell he formerly occupied is now empty," he said. "Are you anxious to inhabit it for a time?"
<p>"What do you mean, sir?" asked Mamie Blanchard.
<p>"You tipped me off about that gambling house. It was nothing more or less than a trap whereby the Black Star could get a gang of his men into the jail and free him. You know it, and I know it, and it won't do you any good to try to bluff me!"
<p>"Why, how dare you? How perfectly silly!"
<p>"Silly, is it?"
<p>"I never heard of such a thing! This affair must have turned your brain! I came in here yesterday merely to ask you if you required the services of a woman detective. I always have wanted to take up detective work, you know. You told me you did not, and so I left."
<p>"What sort of nonsense is this?" the sheriff cried.
<p>"Nonsense? Oh, I am sorry now that there was nobody else in the office to hear me!" And Miss Mamie Blanchard sat back and smiled at the official on the other side of the desk.
<p>"So that's the way of it!" Kowen said. "You'll stick to that story, will you, because nobody else heard what you said yesterday? Woman detective! You know what you came in here for yesterday - to carry out the orders of the Black Star, help frame up that gambling-house deal - - "
<p>"Really, I do not care to listen to any more such talk!" Mamie Blanchard told him. "I am living with my mother at a respectable private hotel - - "
<p>"And your brother, the one who was going to the dogs?"
<p>"Oh, I have no brother! You must be mistaken, sir!"
<p>"You told me yesterday - - "
<p>"Really, you are mistaken. You are confusing my conversation with that of some other person, surely. Brother? Oh, no, sir!"
<p>Sheriff Kowen stared at her. "You are a wonder," he said, "but I am afraid that you can't get away with it. The best thing for you will be tell me all you know about the Black Star, where his headquarters are located, and what he has planned to do. Do that - and do it right - and I may forget all about what happened yesterday."
<p>"But I do not understand you! How should I know anything about that notorious criminal."
<p>"Want me to throw you into that empty cell?"
<p>"You dare!" she said, indignantly. "My people have money, sir, and I can promise you a damage suit that will give you food for thought! Are you not ridiculous enough in the eyes of the public already?"
<p>Sheriff Kowen's face purpled again as he glared at her. He did not doubt, knowing the past history of the Black Star's organization, that this Blanchard woman would cause him trouble.
<p>"Well, I'm going to let you get away with it for the time being," he said. "But don't think for a minute that you're fooling me! You are a member of the Black Star's gang, and I know it! When we land him and the others, we'll land you, too! And you'll get a nice, long sentence from the court!"
<p>Mamie Blanchard stood up. "I do not care to be insulted further!" she said. "I regret that there are no witnesses. If you annoy me any more, I shall bring the matter to my lawyer's attention."
<p>"I suppose he belongs to the gang also," said the sheriff.
<p>He got up, too, but before he did, he touched a button beneath his desk. It caused a buzzer to sound in another office. This told the deputy there that the person leaving the sheriff's private room was to be shadowed.
<p>Kowen opened the door and bowed his visitor out. She held her head high, and there was an expression of indignation in her face. The sheriff watched her disappear into the hall, and then reached for his hat.
<p>On second thought, Kowen had decided to shadow Mamie Blanchard himself, assisting his deputy. He gave Miss Blanchard time to reach the street, and then he started. She was already half a block away, making for the nearest department store, and Kowen saw his faithful deputy trailing her.
<p>Mamie Blanchard, under the eyes of the sheriff and deputy, entered the store and began making purchases in an ordinary manner. Kowen approached the deputy and engaged him in low conversation.
<p>"That's the girl that tipped me off about the gambling house," he said, "and I know blamed well that she belongs to the Black Star's gang. I tried to get some information out of her just now, but she's pretty wise. We'll keep out of her sight, work independently, and trail her. She may lead us to the big crook's headquarters."
<p>Mamie Blanchard made purchases at several departments, and then left the store. If she was aware that she was under surveillance, she did not betray it by her actions. She visited a soda fountain and ate ice cream, emerged again, and finally engaged a taxicab. Sheriff Kowen engaged another, and his deputy a third.
<p>They trailed her to a part of the city where were to be found houses that once had been the homes of wealthy persons of social prominence. But now those of wealth and society had moved to another section, and these relics of other days were rented for various purposes. Here were to be found small shops, cheap boarding houses, palmists, clairvoyants and others of their ilk. Here and there were smaller houses back from the street, some with billboards before them.
<p>Mamie Blanchard left her taxicab at a corner, glanced around, and walked down the street. Kowen and the deputy shadowed her. It was not difficult in this section.
<p>Mamie Blanchard was acting as if apprehensive now. She glanced around continually. Once she stood for several minutes in front of a store window.
<p>"On the right track!" Sheriff Kowen told himself. "She's going to that crook's headquarters, all right, and she wants to make sure she isn't being followed."
<p>He made a sign to his deputy, and they began to approach each other. Mamie Blanchard had walked on down the street. Suddenly she darted through a little gate, and walked swiftly toward one of the smaller houses that sat back from the street.
<p>Kowen and his deputy saw her go into the cottage.
<p>"Go telephone for half a dozen of the men," Kowen ordered the other. "When they come, scatter them around the block, and then come back here to me. Either that house is the Black Star's headquarters, or the people there have something to do with him. I'll watch."
<p>The deputy hurried away, and Kowen kept his eyes on the house. He supposed there was a rear door, but behind the house was a high, blank wall, and he knew that nobody could leave the place without walking directly toward him.
<p>Kowen's heart began pounding at his ribs. If he could capture the Black Star so soon after his escape, he would be the man of the hour. He would show charity by calling in the police and Roger Verbeck, but theirs would be reflected glory, and Kowen knew it well.
<p>The deputy returned at the end of half an hour. Men were posted behind the alley wall, he explained, and were watching the house from the buildings on either side. Nobody could get out without being seen and stopped.
<p>"Then we'll go in," the sheriff said.
<p>They walked boldly to the front door of the cottage, and the sheriff rang the bell. Nobody answered. Three times he rang, and yet nobody came to the door, nor could they hear the slightest sound inside the house.
<p>"They're in there, all right; and won't answer!" Sheriff Kowen whispered to the deputy. "They have spotted us, and know that we have them cornered. I'm going to signal for the other men, and we'll break into the place. It's stretching the law a little, maybe, but I'll run the risk. This isn't like an ordinary case; we're after the Black Star, remember!"
<p>The sheriff gave the signal, and then he and the deputy remained on guard and alert for five minutes, at the end of which time half a dozen more deputies had come from near-by buildings and joined their superior officer. Kowen explained the situation to them in a few words.
<p>"And you want to be ready to go into action!" he concluded. "If the Black Star or any of his gang are in this house, they'll be prepared to put up a fight, and don't forget it! Watch out for those vapor guns and bombs!"
<p>The sheriff rang the bell again, waited for several minutes, gave those inside a last chance to come to the door. But he waited in vain.
<p>"Can't afford to waste any more time," he told his men. "We saw that Blanchard woman go in there, and, from the way she acted before she did, I'm sure this is either the big crook's headquarters or where some of his people are living. Every minute we wait out here, we give them a chance to get ready for us. Two of you men remain outside and see that nobody gets away from the place; I'll call you if we need you inside."
<p>Kowen signaled to one of his biggest deputies. The man advanced, put his shoulder against the door, pressed against it.
<p>"Got it bolted, I guess!" he said.
<p>He backed away, rushed forward, struck the door again with his shoulder, and burst the door open.
<p>Sheriff Kowen and his deputies sprawled into the little front hall of the cottage!
<p>No volley greeted them.
<p>There was no crash of vapor bombs, no cloud of pungent gas, no clash with desperate and determined criminals who fought on behalf of their leader and master!
<p>There was nothing but silence - a silence broken only by the deep breathing of the sheriff and his deputies, who had sprawled into that hall expecting to meet with instant battle, and to whom the unexplained silence was more trying than combat.
<p>Again Sheriff Kowen gave a signal, and one of the men opened the door at the end of the hall. They entered an ordinary living room that was adorned with cheap furniture; it might have been the living room of the home of a family in moderate circumstances.
<p>They passed on to a small dining room, investigating an ordinary bedchamber. Sheriff Kowen began thinking that he had made a serious mistake.
<p>"That woman came in here - and where is she now?" the sheriff said. "Search the rest of the house - go into the basement - don't leave a corner untouched. We're in here now, and we might as well do our work. That woman is here some place, remember that. We saw her come in, and she hasn't left."
<p>They searched the kitchen, another small bedroom, and found nothing, neither a trace of Mamie Blanchard nor anything that would indicate that the cottage was a den of thieves. They located a trap door, and opened it, and saw a flight of steps running down into a dark basement.
<p>"Careful!" Kowen warned his men. "They're probably down there waiting for us! We'll not all run into the trap!"
<p>He delegated one man to remain above. He flashed his electric torch, but could see nothing except the flight of steps and the landing at the bottom. With some of the others close behind him, with his electric torch in one hand and his revolver in the other, Sheriff Kowen started to descend the steps.
<p>Each instant they expected to hear the sound of a shot, or the explosion of a vapor bomb, or to encounter one of the traps rumor said the Black Star always had in his headquarters. Step by step they descended, but nothing happened.
<p>They reached the landing, peered around the corner of a concrete projection. Sheriff Kowen gasped.
<p>"Careful!" he warned again. "This is the headquarters, all right, and there doesn't seem to be anybody here - but you never can tell. Watch out for tricks and traps! Be careful what you touch and where you step. When he was after the Black Star before, Roger Verbeck found himself in a trap when he thought he was boss of the situation - don't forget that!"
<p>The sheriff stepped to the floor, walked a couple of paces away from the steps. He saw an electric switch on the wall, hesitated a moment, and then turned it. The basement was bathed in light.
<p>All the deputies with him were on the floor of the basement now. A chorus of gasps escaped them.
<p>The basement was not like the rest of the house. It was furnished lavishly. In the middle was a long table. At either end was a blackboard on the wall. There were half a score of heavy chairs scattered about. There were some papers on the table.
<p>"Watch the walls," Kowen instructed. "We've found the new headquarters, all right. We'll beat Roger Verbeck and the police this time, thank Heaven! Watch the walls - they're liable to open up and let a gang of thugs in on us any time. I'm going to look at these papers on the table."
<p>He posted his deputies where he wished them, and advanced slowly and carefully across the floor. He was afraid the floor would open and swallow him, afraid of some clever trap that would turn victory into defeat and make him a laughingstock.
<p>He reached the table without accident, and glanced at the papers there. There was no handwriting in sight. The papers had been printed with tiny rubber stamps. Kowen remembered that such was the Black Star's method.
<p>He picked up the nearest and began reading. His eyes bulged and an exclamation escaped him.
<p>"Great - great!" he muttered.
<p>For he was holding in his hands some of the master rogue's orders to his band. Moreover, they had to do with the campaign of crime the Black Star had promised. Kowen read it swiftly:
<p>Number Eleven reports that all is in readiness in his department. Number Four will be at his post a quarter of an hour before midnight. Number Ten will have charge of the men opening the vault. One of the watchmen is a man of ours and will attend to his companion; he is to be bound and gagged afterward by Number Eight, as we may need him again and do not want any suspicion attached to him. Automobiles will be at either end of the alley. Exit through basement door after work is done. The bags of gold are to be put in the limousine, which will be driven by Number Twenty.
<p>"This is great!" Kowen told himself again. "If we only can nab the whole gang - - "
<p>He picked up another sheet of paper, and started reading that. Once more an exclamation of satisfaction escaped him.
<p>Midnight, Tuesday. National Trust Company. Preliminary work completed. All who have received orders will act accordingly. Must be no failure in this first case. Loot will be heavy.
<p>"Going to tap the National Trust, is he?" Sheriff Kowen said. "Well, we'll be ready for him at midnight! He's going to run into a bunch of trouble."
<p>The chief deputy stepped to his side. "Suppose they find out that we have located their headquarters," he said.
<p>"Let us hope they won't find it out," replied the sheriff. "Don't touch another thing here."
<p>"How about that woman?"
<p>"That's the one thing that puzzles me," the sheriff admitted. "She came in here, and we didn't see her leave, and I don't see where she can be. I suppose she came to get orders, or something like that."
<p>"You can bet that there's some other way to get out of here," the deputy told him. "You can bet that the Black Star doesn't let his gang hang around headquarters much. The way he did before was to have them show up one or two at a time, at certain intervals. He's probably issued all his orders and has quit for the day."
<p>One of the other deputies startled them.
<p>"Here's a little trap door - and a tunnel!" he said.
<p>Sheriff Kowen hurried to the corner. The deputy had spoken the truth. There was a small trap door in the floor, and when it was opened the mouth of a narrow tunnel was disclosed. Sheriff Kowen issued his orders rapidly. Into the tunnel they went, flashing their electric torches, revolvers held ready for instant use.
<p>They followed it a distance of a hundred feet - a dusty tunnel that twisted like a serpent. They came to another small door, finally managed to get it open - and stepped through the thick wall into the alley!
<p>"So that is it!" the sheriff exclaimed. "That is how the woman got away from the house without our seeing her! Careful, now! We'll go back and see that everything is as we found it. I've got a little plan that will be a winner!"
<p>Back they went through the tunnel. They closed the door, saw that the rugs were in place and that everything in the basement was as it should be, and went up the flight of steps.
<p>They made sure that nothing in the house had been disturbed, went outside, and found that the front door had not been much damaged. One of the deputies locked and bolted it on the inside, then got out through a window.
<p>"We'll hope that none of his gang has seen us around here," the sheriff explained. "I've got to let the police in on this, but we'll get the credit, all right. I haven't men enough! We'll have deputies and police scattered all around this place to-night, and we'll nab anybody that goes into this cottage, either by the front door or the alley tunnel. We'll be waiting for Mr. Black Star at the National Trust Company's place, too. The police can help, but we'll get the credit! And when we get that crook back in jail - - "
<p>Sheriff Kowen did not finish the sentence, but some of his deputies grinned. They realized that the master crook would be in for a bad hour when he was once more behind the bars. Sheriff Kowen knew how to punish prisoners who tried to escape.
<p>"The big crook isn't as clever as he was before," the sheriff said. "I guess those few months in jail have dulled his wits. If we can catch some of those whelps that worked the game on us and got him away, I'll be highly gratified. I won't need much help when it comes to teaching them a lesson!"
<p>Once more his deputies grinned. They walked to the corner, received fresh orders there, and scattered. Sheriff Kowen engaged a taxicab and ordered the chauffeur to take him to police headquarters with the greatest possible speed, traffic regulations notwithstanding.
<p>He found the chief of police there, and Roger Verbeck in conference with him. Verbeck's big roadster was at the curb, and Muggs was at the wheel. Kowen grinned at him as he entered the building.
<p>"So here you are!" the chief greeted him. "You've got a nerve to show your face after letting the Black Star get away from you!"
<p>"Oh, I don't know!" Kowen said, smiling at them. "Have you gentlemen done anything?"
<p>"What can we do except wait until he pulls off a stunt, and then go after him?" the chief demanded.
<p>"Go after him first! That is what I did."
<p>"Oh, did you?" asked the chief mildly.
<p>"With some measure of success," said the sheriff modestly. "I have discovered the Black Star's headquarters. I have seen some orders to his gang that he left scattered around his table. I found nobody at home when I called, and have every reason to believe that the crook and his gang don't know they have been located."
<p>"Where is the place?" Verbeck asked.
<p>The sheriff told him.
<p>"Possibly you are right," Verbeck said. "But the Black Star is a tricky individual, remember. And the orders are - - "
<p>"At midnight to-night," said Sheriff Kowen, trying to retain his modesty, "the Black Star's gang will try to loot the National Trust Company's vaults. Now, let's get down to business!"
<p>Roger Verbeck and the chief looked at the sheriff aghast. His announcement had startled them. In his previous career of crime, the master criminal had raided that establishment, and had almost wrecked it because he removed so many assets.
<p>"How do you know that, Kowen?" the chief demanded.
<p>The sheriff told the story, not sparing himself, for he wanted to convince the men before him, and now that the recapture of the Black Star seemed so near, he could afford to speak the truth.
<p>He related the story of Mamie Blanchard's first visit to his office, and of how he had trailed her after meeting her on the street.
<p>"That woman," said Verbeck, after Kowen had described her carefully, "is a member of the old organization, and is known as The Princess. She caused us a lot of trouble before."
<p>"She certainly did!" the chief admitted. "She is almost as clever as the Black Star, is trusted by him, and handles a lot of his work. We didn't get her when we caught the Black Star and smashed his old gang, and we had supposed that she had left the country - possibly had gone to South America. She came from Brazil, originally."
<p>Then Kowen continued his story, and told of finding the papers on the table in the basement.
<p>"That's the part of it I don't like," Verbeck said. "It isn't like the master crook to leave papers like those scattered around."
<p>"Didn't you get into his old headquarters once and find papers and orders there?" the sheriff demanded.
<p>"I did, I'll admit. But really I do not like the appearance of this. Describe that basement room to me again, Kowen."
<p>The sheriff did so.
<p>"Well, you seem to have described the room I saw last night," Roger Verbeck said. "Perhaps you are right; but I think we are assuming too much when we think the Black Star's people are not aware of the visit of you and your men there. It would be more like him to have the place watched continually."
<p>"It all looks good to me," the chief put in. "I happen to know that the National Trust Company has a lot of gold in its vault just now - and you can bet that the Black Star knows it, too. That organization of his is a wonder. Why, my own secretary might belong to it, for all I know. We found a police captain in the old one, remember."
<p>"Well, what are we going to do about it?" the sheriff asked.
<p>"What have you to suggest? It's your game," the chief reminded him.
<p>"I've got to have the help of the police, of course," Kowen replied. "I haven't men enough, and this job calls for trained men. I think we should combine forces."
<p>"Certainly," the chief agreed.
<p>"We ought to have a gang around the block that contains that cottage, ready to nab anybody that goes in or comes out; and we ought to be ready for the crook and his gang at the National Trust."
<p>"How do you want to work it?" the chief asked. "Do you want to watch the cottage with your men?"
<p>"I'll send some of my men there, and you do the same," Kowen replied. "And we'll both have men around the bank. I want to be there when the big row comes off. Let's figure it out!"
<p>"Mr. Verbeck is in command of this, as far as I am concerned," the chief informed him.
<p>"That suits me," the sheriff replied.
<p>They spent an hour perfecting their plans, and then the chief began issuing his orders. Those orders went to officers in all parts of the city. They were of such a nature that the Black Star, if some confederate reported them to him, would not be exactly sure what they meant, except that the chief of police expected him to attempt some gigantic crime and would have his men in readiness.
<p>"If you see that Blanchard woman again, put her in the jug!" the chief told the sheriff. "If you are afraid of a suit for damages, turn her over to me. I'm not! She's The Princess, and there is a little charge pending against her right now. Don't forget that."
<p>"If I had arrested her to-day, I wouldn't have found the crook's headquarters," Kowen retorted. "But I'll nab her if I see her again, all right!"
<p>The sheriff, well pleased with the arrangements that had been made, left police headquarters and hurried to his own office, to give orders to his own men. Kowen was exceedingly well pleased with himself. Even the chief of police, his ancient enemy, admitted that he had done the work. Kowen could see, in fancy, the newspapers of the following morning, with their glowing accounts of how, within twenty-four hours after the Black Star's escape, he had located the crook's headquarters, had learned his plans, and had captured him again and broken up his band. That should be political capital, Sheriff Kowen thought.
<p>He reached his office, called his chief deputy, and gave him instructions. He warned the man that orders should be issued carefully so that the Black Star might not learn what was planned.
<p>"We don't want to let that crook think we are wise to his game," Kowen said. "If he does, he'll simply move his headquarters and call off this little robbery. Then we'll have to start all over again - and I want to get that man back in a cell before to-morrow. Newspapers and public jump on me, will they? To-morrow they'll be saying how great I am!"
<p>The chief of police had remained in his office to make further plans. Roger Verbeck left, and went out to the roadster. He ordered Muggs to drive to a certain corner across the city. That meant that Roger Verbeck had some deep thinking to do, for, when he had not, he drove the big roadster himself. So Muggs, with a thousand questions trembling on his lips, kept silent, though he looked at Verbeck reproachfully now and then.
<p>Muggs reached the corner Verbeck had designated, and glanced around scornfully. Muggs did not favor this section of the city. It reminded him too much of certain quarters of Paris where he had existed in years gone by, when he had been a criminal.
<p>"Wait here," Verbeck said.
<p>"Aw, boss, ain't I in on this?" Muggs protested.
<p>"Want to have the car tagged for being left longer than the law allows on this street?" Verbeck demanded. "If I am not back in twenty minutes, drive around the block and wait on the opposite corner - and keep that up until I do put in an appearance."
<p>"This ain't a sweet end of town," Muggs said.
<p>"Are you feeling a certain amount of alarm for me, Muggs? Have you an idea that I cannot take care of myself, in broad daylight?"
<p>"Aw!" Muggs exclaimed, in huge disgust.
<p>"You'll get plenty of action, Muggs, before this thing is over, if that is what is bothering you," Verbeck said. "What I am going to do just now calls for one man, and only one."
<p>Verbeck walked down the street, and Muggs hunched down behind the wheel and glared at those who passed.
<p>Verbeck turned the first corner and disappeared, as far as Muggs was concerned. He journeyed another block, turned another corner, and so approached the little cottage that Sheriff Kowen had investigated. He walked past it slowly, and glanced at the building. There was no sign of life about it.
<p>Verbeck went on around the block and turned into the alley. He found the little door in the wall, but there appeared to be no way of opening it from the outside. He hurried on through the alley and made his way to the front again. If this was, in reality, the Black Star's headquarters, Verbeck did not want to spoil things by having some of the band see him loitering in the neighborhood.
<p>He returned to the roadster, told Muggs to drive him home, and grinned at the look of disgust in Muggs' face.
<p>"Ain't I in on this at all, boss?" Muggs wanted to know. "Gee! When we was after that big crook before, you let me know everything. Don't you trust me no more?"
<p>"Certainly I trust you!" Verbeck told him. "You know that I do! But why bother you with minor details? In other words, Muggs, I am not sure of anything yet."
<p>Reaching his rooms, Roger Verbeck spent the remainder of the day reading books, as if the Black Star and his band did not exist and call for thought. He ordered dinner earlier than usual, and then dressed in a plain dark suit, and put on a soft cap.
<p>"Into the roadster again, old boy," he told Muggs. "Drive me to the same corner."
<p>Muggs did so gladly; but when the corner was reached, he was disgusted once more to find that Verbeck wanted him to remain with the car.
<p>"I don't seem to be nothin' but a chauffeur," he complained to the world at large. "I used to amount to somethin', but I guess I don't any more."
<p>"Muggs, I told you that this is a one-man job," Verbeck said. "And I am the one man!"
<p>He walked on down the street, chuckling at Muggs' grumbling. He passed the little cottage once more. There seemed to be no lights inside it. The yard about it was in pitch darkness, for the glare of the street lights was cut off by the high buildings on either side, by the billboards in front and the alley wall behind.
<p>Verbeck slipped inside the yard. For a time he stood against the billboard and listened, and then he went forward like a shadow, and finally reached a corner of the cottage.
<p>He made his way around the building, listening at doors and windows. He found a window unlatched, and raised it inch by inch, without making the slightest noise. A moment later, Roger Verbeck was inside the house.
<p>He held his electric torch ready, and his automatic. Not a sound reached his ears to indicate the presence of any other human being in the house. Verbeck flashed the torch, located a door, passed through it, and was in the kitchen.
<p>There he found the door leading to the basement, and listened beside it for some time. Then he opened it, slowly, cautiously, a bit at a time. There was no light in the basement.
<p>Verbeck propped the door open with a chair, and descended the steps carefully, not flashing his torch. He reached the bottom, listened for some time, and then pressed the button. The shaft of light flashed across the room.
<p>"Kowen was right - this is the place!" Verbeck told himself. "The furniture - everything seems to be the same. But I don't like it. It doesn't seem right, at all. I never knew the Black Star to be careless like this before."
<p>Verbeck flashed his electric torch again and looked carefully around the room. He even walked across to the table and read the orders Sheriff Kowen had found there. The house was being watched by the police and deputies by this time, Verbeck knew, for the men had received orders to take up their positions soon after nightfall. The officers could be depended upon to capture anybody who visited the cottage.
<p>Verbeck went back up the steps, crept through the house, and got out through the window by which he had entered, and which he now closed again. As he moved away from the house, an officer spoke to him.
<p>"I thought that was you, Mr. Verbeck," he said. "Have you been inside?"
<p>"Yes. There is nobody there now," Verbeck replied. "Is the door in the alley wall being watched?"
<p>"Yes, sir," said the officer. "We've got good men scattered all around the place. If that big crook or any of his people come near here, they'll be nabbed!"
<p>Verbeck hurried up the street and sprang into the roadster, smiling at Muggs' sour look.
<p>"Drive to police headquarters, Muggs," he directed. "We'll stay there until a little before midnight, and then we'll go to the National Trust Company with the chief and his men, and watch for the Black Star. If he really attempts to rob that place to-night, he is going to be caught in the act."
<p>"I'd like to get my two hands on him!" Muggs growled.
<p>"Perhaps you'll have the chance," Verbeck said.
<p>"If I do," Muggs said, "you can bet that the big crook will have a sore throat for a month!"
<p>Muggs drove the powerful roadster slowly through the streets. The newsboys were crying extra editions of the evening papers, editions that had a great deal in them concerning the master crook and his intentions. Verbeck had Muggs stop, and bought the papers, and was glad to see that there was no inkling of Kowen's discovery in them.
<p>Verbeck did not feel satisfied. Remembering the Black Star's methods, he could not convince himself that the master rogue would let himself be captured again just as he inaugurated his campaign of crime. If the National Trust Company was to be robbed, the Black Star would be there in person, unless he had changed his tactics, for previously he always had commanded his men during a big crime.
<p>But even the greatest criminals are wrecked by trivial accidents, Verbeck knew well, and so he tried to tell himself that it was a careless woman member of the band who had betrayed the crook's headquarters and plans. Yet it was foreign to the character of The Princess, as Mamie Blanchard was called by the members of the organization, to be careless.
<p>"Well, we'll know the truth soon!" Roger Verbeck told himself.
<p>They reached police headquarters and went inside. The chief was waiting for them.
<p>"Everything ready!" he announced. "We're going to land that crook quick this time! I'm taking no chances, you can bet! I'll have every available man around the National Trust Company's building. I've got some of them inside right now, and in the adjoining building, and there will be a crowd in the alley and in the streets."
<p>"I went up and took a look at that cottage," Verbeck said.
<p>"So that's what you were up to!" Muggs put in.
<p>"How did it look?" the chief asked.
<p>"Well, I can't swear to it, of course, but that basement room looked like the one where the Black Star had me last night; and the orders Kowen told us about were on the table. I didn't touch them, but I read them."
<p>"Let us hope the crook doesn't get wise to the fact that we are on to him," said the chief.
<p>"The chances are," said Verbeck, "that he had completed his work when Kowen and his men got inside the house, and that the Blanchard woman was the last of the band to visit there to-day. If the Black Star follows out his usual method, he'll hurry back there after he pulls off the robbery, providing we don't get him at the bank."
<p>"And if he dodges us at the bank, the men will pick him up when he goes back to the cottage - very pretty!" the chief said. "Verbeck, I have an idea that we are going to win to-night. The rogue's good luck has deserted him, that's all."
<p>The chief opened a box of cigars and passed it around. From time to time a sergeant came in to report about men being posted. Now and then some detective telephoned rumors and information he had gathered.
<p>"The streets are jammed," the chief said, after one of these telephone calls. "The blamed newspapers are out with big stories of how the Black Star telephoned them that he would start his campaign of crime at midnight. Well, somebody in the mob might get hurt, but it helps us, in a way. It has been easier for us to get our men placed without some of the crook's gang reporting the fact to him."
<p>"Oh, the chances are that he knows all about it," Verbeck said. "And he probably doesn't care. The Black Star is original, don't forget that. He'll not try to rob that trust company in any usual manner. He'll get into the building with his men in some way we do not expect, and if we're not on guard he'll get out again - with bags of gold. Did you inform the bank officials?"
<p>"Great Scott, no!" gasped the chief. "They'd light up the place, remove the gold, give the whole thing away. We want to catch the Black Star. I'll guarantee that he'll never get away with anything there to-night. You don't seem to have much confidence, Verbeck."
<p>"I haven't," Verbeck admitted. "I fought the Black Star before, you know. I can't make myself think that he will walk into a trap - yet everything seems to point toward it. Well, I'll be going, I guess. It is eleven o'clock now."
<p>Muggs followed him to the curb, and this time Verbeck took the wheel when they got into the roadster. He drove through the city and toward the place where he lived, and, when he was sure that he was not being followed, he circled through the streets and approached the retail section of the city again.
<p>Verbeck parked the roadster several blocks away from the National Trust Company. Then he and Muggs made their way through the crowd in the street, their caps pulled down over their eyes, Verbeck hoping that he would escape recognition.
<p>They went through an alley, and stopped in the darkness just before they reached the other street. The rear of the trust company building was just opposite them.
<p>"A quarter to twelve," Verbeck whispered. "The chief is to meet us here. The sergeants know where he is to be in case he is needed quickly."
<p>"Why not get into the bank building?" Muggs asked. "Are we going to stay here in the alley and let a bunch of policemen do this thing? Gee, boss, ain't we goin' to handle it ourselves?"
<p>"We'll be right on hand, Muggs, if anything starts," Verbeck promised him. "Don't worry about that!"
<p>Five minutes later, the chief found them there.
<p>"Now for the big drama!" the chief whispered. "Everybody is set and ready. That master criminal, as he calls himself, is due to receive the surprise of his life in a few minutes. I only hope he is on the job himself - glad to nab any of his crowd, of course, but he is the man we want in particular."
<p>"Those orders read 'midnight,'" Verbeck said. "If he carries them out, we haven't long to wait."
<p>"Got an idea he won't carry 'em out?" the chief asked.
<p>"He may know that we are aware of his intention," Verbeck replied. "He isn't fool enough to walk into a trap when he knows where the trap is, you know."
<p>The chief flashed his torch and glanced at his watch.
<p>"Well, it's three minutes of midnight now," he said. "I wonder how he'll try it."
<p>"He certainly will not walk up to the front door and break it down," said Verbeck, chuckling.
<p>"I've got men in the basements of the buildings on both sides of the trust company," the chief said. "If he tries to use a tunnel, he'll find himself caught."
<p>"He came down from the sky on one occasion," Verbeck reminded the chief.
<p>"Look!" Muggs cried.
<p>He had glanced up at the sky as Verbeck spoke, and now was clutching at their sleeves and asking them to look up, too. Far above the city a bright light appeared, a light that traveled in circles. It grew larger and brighter rapidly. It blazed forth like a monster searchlight, and bathed in splendor the building of the National Trust Company.
<p>"Airplane!" Muggs gasped.
<p>"Then he's a long way up in the air," said the chief. "An airplane makes considerable noise! It isn't an airplane!"
<p>"Then what is it?" Verbeck asked.
<p>"You've got me - but it isn't an airplane, or, if it is, it must be a couple of miles high. That light doesn't seem to be that high up."
<p>The crowds in the street were yelling and shrieking now. The searchlight continued to bathe the trust company's building in brilliance. The police and deputies posted around the corner were amazed. Sheriff Kowen, on the other side of the building, ran around like an insane man, calling upon his men to do something.
<p>The light was extinguished; and again it blazed forth, and this time it swept up and down the alley, revealing the chief and Verbeck and Muggs, and officers who had been posted there.
<p>"The Black Star has something to do with that!" the chief said.
<p>"And he's spotted us!" said Verbeck.
<p>"Then we lose, for he'll not try to rob the trust company."
<p>"Don't be too sure of that! Some of his band may be in there now, and this light, wherever it is, may be to attract our attention while other men carry away the loot."
<p>"I've got plenty of men in the building," the chief replied, "and they'll flash a signal the moment they see anybody that doesn't belong in there. That light gets me. How high do you suppose it is?"
<p>"It's comin' closer to the ground," said Muggs.
<p>Once more the light was extinguished, and the crowds in the street grew silent. Again it blazed forth, and this time it was so bright and near that a man could not look into it.
<p>Then they heard a laugh, and the well-known voice of the Black Star.
<p>"Hello, chief! Hello, Verbeck and Muggs! Watching the trust company, are you? I'm afraid that'll not do any good!"
<p>The chief drew his revolver and fired rapidly into the air. The Black Star's sarcastic laugh reached them, and the light was extinguished again. The sky was black; they saw nothing, heard nothing.
<p>"What kind of a thing is this?" the chief gasped. "He wasn't more than a hundred feet above us when he spoke. What can it be? He can't be in an airplane, or we'd hear the roar of the engine!"
<p>"And his band is probably looting the vault of the trust company right now, or has looted it!" Verbeck said.
<p>He ran quickly across the street, and Muggs and the chief followed at his heels. They knocked on a rear door of the building, and it was opened at once.
<p>"Everything all right?" the chief asked.
<p>"Nothing doing yet, chief," replied the detective who had opened the door.
<p>"We'll take a look and make sure," the chief said. "I don't like this business at all!"
<p>They went through a corridor and found the two watchmen. They had the lights in the vault room switched on.
<p>"That vault hasn't been touched," Verbeck said, "unless they have tunneled from beneath. The door hasn't been opened."
<p>"That crook was wise," the chief declared. "He knew that we were here waiting for him. How he found it out is more than I can tell - some of Sheriff Kowen's carelessness, I suppose."
<p>A detective came running toward them through the corridor.
<p>"Chief!" he shrieked. "Sergeant just came from headquarters! He says that the Black Star's gang is looting the First National - just got the alarm!"
<p>The forces of law and order would have been interested, that day, had they watched Mamie Blanchard continually.
<p>When she entered the little cottage, she locked the door on the inside, hurried through the kitchen and into the basement, and entered the tunnel. She went through it quickly, reached the door in the alley wall, listened, opened it, slipped into the alley, and slammed the door shut again. That door could not be opened from the outside unless a person knew exactly how to do it.
<p>Mamie Blanchard hurried through the alley to the street, engaged a taxicab, and drove to a certain hotel, where she ascended in the elevator and went directly to a suite. It was not the same hotel she had visited after telling Sheriff Kowen about the gambling house, but she found the same people there - a middle-aged woman and a middle-aged man.
<p>"Well?" the man asked gruffly.
<p>"Couldn't be better," said Mamie Blanchard.
<p>"What happened?"
<p>"I let him see me, and he took me to his office in the jail. Said he knew that I was a member of the Black Star's band, and threatened to put me in a cell if I didn't tell all I knew. I bluffed him, of course, and then he got the wise idea of letting me go and trailing me. You could almost see it sticking out on his forehead." Miss Blanchard stopped to laugh.
<p>"Go on!" the man commanded.
<p>"The sheriff and a deputy trailed me. When I got near the cottage, I began acting in a peculiar manner. I hurried inside, locked the door, and went out through the tunnel and the alley. At the corner, I saw the sheriff and his deputy still looking at the cottage."
<p>"Well, you did your part!" the man said. "Now we'll wait to learn whether the rest of the plan worked out."
<p>They waited for half an hour. Then the telephone rang, and the man answered. When he hung up the receiver and turned away, he was grinning.
<p>"It worked!" he said. "Number Ten has just reported. The sheriff sent for more men, and broke into the house. They found the basement room and read the orders, and they found the tunnel, too. Number Ten reports that the sheriff has gone to police headquarters."
<p>"And that means," said Mamie Blanchard, "that there'll be half a hundred cops around that cottage to-night, and all the rest will be at the National Trust Company."
<p>"Exactly! And while they are at the National Trust, we'll be looting the First National. That fake headquarters did the trick - just as the big boss said it would!"
<p>"What now, Landers?" Miss Blanchard asked.
<p>It was the first time she had spoken his name. Like herself, Landers had been in the Black Star's old organization, and now was one of the master criminal's shrewd lieutenants. He had helped organize the new band, and had engineered the Black Star's rescue.
<p>"I must go and report," he said. "I'll report for you, too. You'd better stay pretty close to this suite for a few days. They'll be looking for you now, you know."
<p>"I might as well be in jail as be a prisoner here," Mamie Blanchard pouted.
<p>"It's orders!" Landers told her. "You'll be needed again soon, and needed badly."
<p>Landers left the hotel, engaged a taxicab, and drove out along the river road until he came to a resort. He paid the chauffeur there, and walked along the shore, watching the bathers, acting like a prosperous man on a little holiday.
<p>But after a time he left the resort and walked on along the road. He turned into a lane, when he was sure that he was not being observed, and approached a ramshackle farmhouse that was hidden in a grove.
<p>Landers entered the house, went down a flight of steps to the basement, and stopped in a little room. There he put on a long black robe and his black mask, and touched a button. In the distance a bell tinkled. Then a buzzer sounded, and Landers opened the door and stepped into the Black Star's headquarters.
<p>The master rogue was sitting at one end of the table. He got up and stepped to the nearest blackboard. Landers went to the one at the other end of the room, and picked up the chalk.
<p>"Number One," he wrote.
<p>"Countersign?" wrote the Black Star.
<p>"Amboy."
<p>"Report!" the Black Star wrote.
<p>Landers turned to the blackboard and wrote rapidly.
<p>"Sheriff decoyed to fake headquarters. Decoy escaped in manner planned. Sheriff broke in and found room in basement. Number Ten reported to me that everything was left as it was, and that sheriff went immediately to police headquarters."
<p>"Good," wrote the Black Star.
<p>"Any further orders?"
<p>"Act to-night in accordance with the orders given you yesterday," the Black Star wrote. "That is all."
<p>Landers bowed, and backed from the room. He took off mask and gown and hung them up, put on his hat and gloves, and made his way from the house and into the lane again. Once more he was the prosperous gentleman enjoying a day in the woods and along the river.
<p>Back in the old farmhouse, the Black Star was receiving another report, this time by telephone.
<p>"Number Eight," said the voice.
<p>"Countersign?" asked the Black Star.
<p>"Harvard!"
<p>"Well?"
<p>"I have been in communication with Number Twelve, who is in police headquarters. Sheriff Kowen went there and held a conference with the chief and Roger Verbeck. They fell hard for that fake headquarters stunt. They are planning to watch the place to-night, and all officers not there will be in the neighborhood of the National Trust Company, where they expect us to strike."
<p>"Very good!" the Black Star said. "You have your orders for to-night?"
<p>"Yes, sir."
<p>"Carry them out. There is nothing new!"
<p>The master rogue hung up the receiver, put the telephone away in a secret niche in the wall, and sat down at the end of the long table again. A man entered with a tray containing luncheon, and the Black Star removed his mask and ate. The servant was a member of the old organization, and took part in no crimes - it was not necessary for the Black Star to wear a mask in his presence.
<p>Having eaten, the master criminal stretched himself on a couch in one corner of the room, and slept. It was dusk when he awakened. He ate again, and as he finished the little bell on the wall jangled. The Black Star put on his mask, and touched a button.
<p>The robed and masked man who entered was small. He went directly to the blackboard.
<p>"Number Sixteen," he wrote.
<p>"Countersign?"
<p>"Providence."
<p>"Report!"
<p>"First National received shipment of currency to-day as expected," the other wrote.
<p>"What amount?"
<p>"Three hundred thousand."
<p>"What else have you to report?"
<p>"One of the watchmen is our man, and he will attend to the other. Number Twenty has investigated the vault, and reports that he can open it in twelve or fifteen minutes."
<p>"How about transportation?" the Black Star wrote.
<p>"One limousine and three closed autos; all has been arranged."
<p>"Good!" the Black Star wrote. "That is all - except I want no mistakes made to-night."
<p>The other man left the room. The master criminal touched a bell button, and the servant entered.
<p>"Has the mechanic reported?" the Black Star asked.
<p>"Yes, sir. The machine is in perfect working order, sir. He will test it further after dark."
<p>"Very well. I want him to be ready to start about eleven thirty, perhaps a quarter of an hour sooner than that."
<p>"Yes, sir."
<p>The servant bowed and left the room. The Black Star took paper out of a drawer, and a box of rubber stamps, and began composing a letter that was to cause the chief of police, the sheriff and Roger Verbeck much chagrin before morning.
<p>To those poor fools whom it most concerns:
<p>I was amused at the manner in which you guarded the little cottage so well. That fake headquarters was placed there in order to have you send all officers to the National Trust Building. I understand it fooled even Roger Verbeck. You may place all the blame on the sheriff, since he responded so well to my decoy. While you guard the National Trust, I shall be looting the First National of the shipment of currency it received to-day. It is the first blow in my campaign. And when you learn that I am looting it, and rush there, I shall - - But you will know what by the time you read this note.
<p>The Black Star put the folded note into an envelope, and addressed it to the chief of police. Then he composed another to be mailed to a prominent newspaper.
<p>The Black Star put the letter into an envelope, addressed it, and then put both letters into one of his pockets. He glanced at his watch, and took off his robe, but retained the mask. He donned a heavy ulster, and rang for the servant again.
<p>"Tell the mechanic to be ready in ten minutes," he said.
<p>"Yes, sir."
<p>"After I have left the house, throw on the protecting current, and do not turn it off unless you get the proper signal."
<p>"I understand, sir."
<p>"The wires were tested this afternoon?"
<p>"Yes, sir; everything is in excellent condition."
<p>"Good!" said the Black Star.
<p>At a quarter of twelve that night, a man walked rapidly through the alley behind the First National Bank. He knocked on the basement door of the building adjoining. The door was opened by a watchman.
<p>"Everything's all right," the watchman reported.
<p>"Did you attend to that other fellow?"
<p>"He'll sleep for a couple of hours yet."
<p>"Fine work. You are to disappear after this, of course. Go to the hiding place arranged for you, and you will be sent ample funds. You are not to attempt to leave the city until you get orders to do so. Understand?"
<p>"Sure. I know my business, all right."
<p>"You'd better! The boss is going to be mighty strict during this campaign of his. The man who makes a mistake or disobeys orders won't last very long. Where are the robes?"
<p>The watchman opened a box, took out a robe, and handed it over. The other man put it on quickly, affixed the mask, and started toward a door that opened into the basement of the bank building adjoining. At the door, he turned again.
<p>"Let the others in, and tell them that they are to hurry," he told the watchman. "They'll give the usual signal, of course. Hand them their masks and gowns."
<p>He opened the door and hurried into the other basement, went up a flight of steps, unlocked another door, and was on the first floor of the bank.
<p>Down in the basement, the watchman admitted other men who arrived two minutes apart, until twelve in all were in the building, and gave them robes and masks. They hurried into the other basement and up the stairs, and took up their positions.
<p>Some guarded the stairways that led to the second floor. Others were scattered around the first floor, watching the doors and windows. Two hurried into the vault room.
<p>The shades had been drawn at all the windows, and were fastened securely at the sides and bottoms so that no light could be seen from the outside. An electric torch was flashed on the door of the vault, and held there, and one of the men began working on the lock with tools taken from beneath his robe.
<p>"It's a cinch!" he whispered. "The more intricate they are, the easier it is to open them. I didn't work once in a safe factory for nothing!"
<p>Save for the rasping of tools against steel and the heavy breathing of the man who worked, there was silence in the vault room and in the rest of the building. Presently there came a sharp click, the workman gasped his satisfaction and stood up. The big door was pulled open.
<p>Both men hurried inside the vault. They began stuffing packages of bills into canvas bags which had been in the box with the robes.
<p>"That's all!" one of them whispered to the other. "The boss said for us not to bother with securities or any of the small stuff. We'll go!"
<p>"We'd better, or they'll be on us in another minute," the other man replied nervously. "When you opened that door you sent in an alarm."
<p>"And it went to a protective agency where the man on night duty is one of us," the other replied, chuckling. "He'll have to give out the alarm, of course, but by the time he gives it out, we'll be far away. What time is it now?"
<p>"Twelve thirty."
<p>"Just right! Send the signal to the others. The lieutenant is standing by the window at the end of the hall."
<p>A hiss escaped the man's lips, and was carried and echoed through the building. The men gathered in the corridor, the lieutenant made sure all of them were there, and then they descended into the basement, and passed from it to the one adjoining.
<p>"Signal for the autos," the watchman was ordered. "Then make your own get-away. And be sure you remember all that you've been told. Obey orders!"
<p>The watchman stepped into the dark alley, and flashed an electric torch five times. A chauffeur at the mouth of the alley counted the flashes, and honked his horn. A procession of four automobiles started through the alley.
<p>They did not stop, but merely slowed down, and into each machine sprang the men who had been assigned seats there. The automobiles continued through the alley and turned into the next street, where the chauffeurs put on speed.
<p>There were few persons in that particular section of the city at the time, but those who were on the street saw the automobiles filled with robed and masked men. They knew what that meant - that the Black Star's band was working in the vicinity. Their terror kept them dumb until the automobiles had disappeared, and then they gave the alarm. They knew that there was but one thing in that section that would attract the master crook - and that was the vault of the old First National. The alarm went to police headquarters.
<p>A few blocks down the street, the automobiles scattered, and one by one made their way to dark parts of the town, where the men in them took off their robes and masks, and, one by one, left the machines and darted away.
<p>The band was scattered fifteen minutes after the vault had been looted, and one machine, a closed one, was running out along the river road toward the resort. The chauffeur drove in a leisurely manner, and the car attracted no undue attention.
<p>At the end of the lane running to the old farmhouse, where it was pitch dark, the door of the closed car was opened, and a man sprang out. The automobile went on along the river road. The man who had jumped from it carried two canvas bags stuffed with currency. He was Landers, the Black Star's trusted lieutenant.
<p>Landers hurried along the lane, entered the grove about the house, and took a telephone from its hiding place behind a clump of brush. He called the house, and the servant who remained on guard at the headquarters answered.
<p>Landers gave a password, then put the telephone away and sprang to his feet. He came to the wire fence that ran around the house, but he did not touch it. He knew that it was charged with a deadly current. A light flashed in a window, and Landers opened the gate and went on to the house. He disappeared inside. His work for the night was done, except that he had to turn in the swag.
<p>But the Black Star and his band were not done for the night. The men who had left the automobiles and scattered, immediately made their way to the National Trust Company's building, and lost themselves in the throng of people there. They bumped elbows with policemen and deputies and detectives, and grinned when they recognized one another in the crowd.
<p>They were in time to hear the alarm given, and to see policemen spring into automobiles and hurry away. They saw Muggs drive through the crowd, and Roger Verbeck spring into the roadster and start for the First National Bank. Word flashed through the crowd that the master rogue's band was looting the First National, and the crowd melted away like snow beneath a blazing sun, hurrying toward the scene of the robbery.
<p>One by one, and cautiously, the Black Star's men entered the alley behind the National Trust Company's building. Here, too, a basement door was opened for them by a watchman. Once more they put on masks and gowns from a supply that was in readiness, and posted their guards in the building. Once more two selected men hurried into the vault room.
<p>They began their work on the door of the vault; and suddenly the Black Star himself appeared before them, his face masked, the flaming star of jet on the hood of his robe.
<p>"Make it as quick as possible!" he ordered. "We don't want to be here too long. Did things go all right at the other place? Was the get-away good?"
<p>"Everything went off as planned, sir," one of the men reported. "The work was done to the minute, and the get-away was as you had ordered, sir."
<p>"Disguise your voice when you speak to me, you fool!" the Black Star said. "And hurry with that vault! We can't spend all night getting inside that box!"
<p>The rasping of tools against steel, the heavy breathing of the workman told that the man was doing his best to hurry. But the vault of the National Trust Company was a complicated affair, and it was a quarter of an hour before the door finally was swung open.
<p>"Lively, now!" the Black Star commanded. "Those bags of gold are what we want - and all we want here at this time. Get them to the rear door as soon as possible, and signal for the autos. All you men get busy!"
<p>The masked and robed members of the band carried the heavy bags from the vault, hurried through the corridor with them, went down the stairs, and to the basement door.
<p>The Black Star watched the work. When it was completed, he walked across the room to the nearest telephone, took down the receiver, and gave the number of police headquarters.
<p>"Is the chief there?" he asked.
<p>"He's here, but he's busy. What do you want with him? Who is this?" the desk sergeant demanded.
<p>"I think he'll talk to me, all right. This is the Black Star talking."
<p>There was an exclamation at the other end of the wire, and presently the chief spoke.
<p>"Hello! This is the chief!"
<p>"This is the Black Star! Did my new searchlight puzzle you a bit to-night, chief? When you know the secret you'll be more startled than puzzled. Did you wonder where my voice came from, and how I happened to be in the air just over you? Maybe you got the idea that I was putting on a ventriloquist's act."
<p>"We'll get you, you fiend!" the chief cried angrily into the transmitter.
<p>"Why, chief, how violent you sound! I am afraid you are working yourself into a passion."
<p>"You got away with it this time, but you'll not do it again. And you had to lie to do it this time!"
<p>"Indeed? How is that?"
<p>"You used to boast of what you were going to do, and dare us to catch you at it, and you always told the truth in those days. You must be losing your nerve. You said, you crook, that you were going to rob the National Trust - and then you went after the First National."
<p>"Oh, that was just a little job on the side!" the Black Star said. "I told you no falsehood, chief. I said that I would rob the National Trust, and that is exactly what I have done. I am speaking from the vault room of the National Trust this very minute. I have just removed several bags of gold coins!"
<p>"What's that?" the chief cried.
<p>"I am leaving a letter here in the vault room for you, chief, and have just mailed another to a certain newspaper. You'd better come right over here and get your letter, chief. And thanks so much for rushing all your silly policemen over to the First National when you got the alarm, so they would not bother my men here. It was very thoughtful of you!"
<p>The Black Star laughed, and put up the receiver. He laid the letter addressed to the chief in the middle of the table, and pasted little black stars around the room on the marble. He ran to a rear window and saw three automobiles passing through the alley. In them were his men, he knew, and also the gold coin taken from the supposedly impregnable vault of the National Trust.
<p>The Black Star laughed again, went to the stairs, and began mounting them, flight by flight, stopping now and then to laugh at a bound and gagged watchman. Presently he reached the roof by means of a trap door. He closed the door again, and fastened it securely. Then he took an electric torch from his pocket, and flashed a signal toward the sky.
<p>He removed his robe, rolled it up, put it beneath his arm. He picked up his heavy ulster from the roof, where he had left it before descending into the bank, and put it on.
<p>Once more he pointed the electric torch upward and flashed a signal. Then he touched match to cigarette, walked to the edge of the building, and glanced over.
<p>He heard the sirens of police automobiles in the distance. He saw the machines stop and policemen spring from them. He watched as they gained entrance to the building, saw a crowd gathering in the street below. The Black Star chuckled again, took a vapor bomb from the pocket of his ulster, and hurled it at the street. It struck, exploded, and a cloud of white, pungent vapor drifted across the pavement. Shrieks and cries of alarm reached his ears. He saw one policeman stagger and fall, overcome by the gas.
<p>The Black Star, still chuckling, walked back to the middle of the roof. He flashed another signal, and then returned the torch to his pocket.
<p>He laughed again - and waited!
<p>Police headquarters was thrown into a turmoil for the second time that night when the chief received the master criminal's telephone message.
<p>Roger Verbeck and Muggs rushed for the roadster, sprang in, and drove like mad through the streets toward the National Trust Company's building.
<p>The chief shrieked his orders, officers tumbled into department automobiles, and followed Verbeck. They reached their destination, and sprang out. Verbeck already had ascertained that the front doors of the bank were locked and bolted. He rushed around to the alley, followed by Muggs, the chief, and a dozen officers. A detective hurried to telephone Sheriff Kowen.
<p>The basement door was open, and they rushed inside. They found the watchman bound and gagged - he was a member of the Black Star's band, but they needed him again, and so made the attempt to remove all suspicion.
<p>"The Black Star!" he gasped when they had removed the gag and bonds. "He was here with his gang! They carried out gold - went away in autos and - - "
<p>Verbeck had rushed on to the vault room. The chief and some of the others followed. They found the door of the vault standing open, money scattered on the floor, papers in confusion.
<p>"He cleaned out all the big stuff!" the chief said. "One of you men telephone the president of the trust company and tell him to hurry down here."
<p>"Here's the letter he mentioned, chief," Verbeck said.
<p>The chief ripped it open and read it, then thrust it into one of his pockets. As he turned away, there was a sharp explosion in the street, then a bedlam of shrieks and cries. They rushed to a window and threw it open.
<p>"Bomb!" somebody in the street was shouting. "It came from the roof!"
<p>"One of that crook's gas bombs!" the chief exclaimed. "On the roof, is he?"
<p>Verbeck already was running toward the stairs, with Muggs just behind him, determined to be in the midst of the affair. Muggs had been complaining again that he was not playing a principal part in this drama, and that he felt he was entitled to one.
<p>Half a dozen officers took after them, the chief bellowed orders and posted guards throughout the bank. He sent other men to the floors above to release the watchmen. And then he followed Roger Verbeck, running up the stairs, puffing and panting, wishing that the elevator was running.
<p>They came to the little steel stairs that led to the trapdoor and the roof. Verbeck tried to open the door, and found that it was fastened on the outside.
<p>"Either the Black Star or some of his men are up there!" Verbeck said. "The door wouldn't be locked on the outside, otherwise."
<p>One of the detectives had procured a fire ax from the hall on the floor below. He ran up the steel stairs and attacked the heavy door vigorously. The chief sent a man for another ax.
<p>More officers had come up the stairs now, and stood at the bottom of the steel steps, waiting for the trapdoor to be opened.
<p>"As soon as we get through, rush up there and go at them," the chief directed. "We don't know how many are up there, so be ready to mix it! Shoot, if you have to, but get him alive if you can. And look out for vapor guns and gas bombs!"
<p>"Somebody on the roof is asking for you, chief!" the man with the ax called down.
<p>The chief hurried up the steps. "Well, who is it?" he demanded.
<p>"This is the Black Star. Can't you recognize my voice? Still practicing violence, I see, and this time on a door!"
<p>"Well, what do you want?" the chief cried. "Do you want to give yourself up?"
<p>"Certainly not, my dear chief. I just wanted to let you know that I was here."
<p>"And we're going to get you!" the chief cried. "If it is necessary we'll get you with a gun! If you start using that vapor stuff when we get the door open, my men will shoot. Understand that? I'll give you one minute to surrender and open the door!"
<p>"Why on earth should I do such a thing as that?" the Black Star wanted to know.
<p>"Because you are at the end of your rope, that's why!" the chief replied. "If you try to go down a fire escape, you'll be plugged. And that's the only way you can get off the roof."
<p>"I have no intention of going down a fire escape," the Black Star replied. "I give you my word of honor - or dishonor, if you prefer it that way - that I shall descend no fire escape to-night. Does that satisfy you?"
<p>"Are you going to give yourself up?"
<p>"Dear me, no! I couldn't think of it. I have had a very pleasant evening, chief - very pleasant indeed - and profitable, also. By the way, did you get your letter?"
<p>An exasperated chief descended the steps and motioned for the detective to go to work with the ax again. The heavy blows began raining against the door. Between them, they could hear the Black Star laughing.
<p>"Get through that door!" the chief shrieked. "We've got him in a trap!"
<p>"I wouldn't be too sure of that," said Roger Verbeck. "He seemed to speak with confidence."
<p>"But how can he get away?"
<p>"The Black Star used to be noted for doing some peculiar and seemingly impossible things," Verbeck reminded the chief.
<p>"I want to be the second man through that door!" Muggs said. "I got it comin' to me, boss. You ain't let me do a thing to-day, and I want to get my hands on that big crook!"
<p>"That's what we all want to do," the chief remarked. "Get ready, men; that door will be open in a minute!"
<p>The detective had succeeded in cutting a hole in it. Now he put his face close to the aperture and looked out. He could see nothing but darkness. Cautiously, he extended a hand and felt for the bolt, located it, shot it back. He whispered the news to those behind him. The officers crowded the steel stairs, and Muggs got well in the van. Muggs declined to be sidetracked longer.
<p>The detective threw the door open, and they stumbled up the steps and to the roof, their weapons held ready, to dart to either side, expecting a shot, or a vapor bomb at least.
<p>Their electric torches flashed, and the roof was bathed in light. There was nothing behind which a person could hide, except two chimneys. The officers approached the chimneys, carefully, ready for instant combat. They circled them - and found nobody.
<p>"He's here - got to be here!" the chief cried.
<p>They rushed to all the fire escapes and found that nobody was on them. They shouted to officers in the street below, and were told that the fire escapes had not been used. They searched every square foot of the roof, looked along the parapet, found nobody.
<p>"I tell you that crook's got to be here!" the chief shouted. "How could he get away?"
<p>"Airplane," one of the detectives suggested.
<p>"Don't be an ass!" the chief shrieked. "An airplane makes a lot of noise. And it wouldn't be easy to pick up a man from a roof in the dark, you fool! The only way it could be done would be to trail a rope and let him grab it, and that would mean a dead man on the pavement below. You ass, an airplane travels with speed!"
<p>"Well, he doesn't seem to be here," Verbeck offered.
<p>"But where could he have gone?" the chief cried. "Even the Black Star can't make himself invisible at will!"
<p>Then they heard the Black Star laugh derisively.
<p>They flashed their torches and again searched the roof. Once more they heard the laugh. Now it seemed to be to one side of them, and now to another. Above them, behind them, in front of them they heard it.
<p>"This thing will drive me crazy!" the chief cried. "Flash those torches again! That crook is somewhere right here on the roof! Look for another trapdoor!"
<p>They searched the roof, and found nothing; but again they heard the laugh, only it sounded far away now. Suddenly the roof was bathed in bright light that seemed to come out of the sky.
<p>"He's up there - on something!" the chief shrieked.
<p>They emptied their revolvers and automatics toward the sky. The light died out, flashed forth again and almost blinded them. Once more they heard the sarcastic laugh of the Black Star, as if far in the distance - and then the light was gone.
<p>They stood silent, looking upward. Not the slightest sound came to their ears, except echoes of the shouts in the street below, where people were wondering about the peculiar, blinding light.
<p>"What does it mean?" the chief cried. "Verbeck, what has that devil done?"
<p>"I haven't the faintest idea," Roger Verbeck replied. "I don't understand that laugh, and I can't imagine where that light comes from. I'd think naturally, that it was an airplane, but, as you said, it would be almost impossible to pick a man off the roof at night - and an airplane makes a lot of noise. And we didn't hear a sound - remember that!"
<p>Once more the voice of the Black Star reached their ears. He seemed to be shouting to them, and to be not so very far away.
<p>"Good night, gentlemen!" he called to them. "It has been a splendid evening of amusement and profit. Good night - and let me express the hope that you'll have pleasant dreams!"
<p>That was all. Though they waited on the roof for half an hour longer, they heard nothing more from him, saw nothing of him, and finally they turned and went back down the stairs, puzzled, angry, but determined to make the master rogue pay.
<p>The newspapers the following day were full of the exploits of the Black Star. They explained that the master crook had inaugurated his campaign of crime and revenge by looting two of the richest financial institutions in the city. From the First National his men had obtained more than three hundred thousand dollars in currency. From the vault of the National Trust Company had been taken a quarter of a million in gold coin.
<p>Banking officials were frantic. They made arrangements to safeguard their property, fearing to lose the confidence of their depositors. They engaged extra watchmen, men they knew personally, since to engage a stranger, no matter how good his references, might be to put one of the Black Star's men in the place.
<p>Sheriff Kowen and his deputies were blamed, the chief and his policemen were declared incompetent and inefficient, and Roger Verbeck and Muggs were held up to ridicule.
<p>The mysterious light that had come out of the sky was described at length, and many speculations made as to its nature. The scene on the roof of the building, told by one of the detectives, was played up, and there were many conjectures as to what it meant.
<p>Had the master criminal come into possession of some wonderful new invention? Was he able to escape when and as he liked? Some inclined toward this belief, and others declared that the Black Star had gone down a fire escape under the noses of the officers, entered the building through a window at some floor, walked down the stairs and emerged into the alley and gone his way. The Black Star, one paper stated, was a mere man and did not call upon the supernatural to aid him. He merely had better brains than the police.
<p>Where would he strike next?
<p>Within three days, he had said in his letter to one of the papers, he would steal, with the aid of his band, jewels and famous objects of art. Thousands of persons had valuable jewels, and it was well known that the master criminal was a gem fiend, that he had a great collection and gloated over them. Perhaps he meant a jewelry establishment, a wholesale diamond house.
<p>When it came to famous objects of art, there was a wealth of them in the city. Two millionaires had great collections. There was a famous museum that housed several hundred priceless paintings. Here and there throughout the city were others.
<p>Jewels were carried to safe-deposit vaults. The guards at the museum were doubled. The two millionaires obtained police protection for their residences. And the city waited.
<p>Two days passed, during which nothing was heard of the Black Star and his band. Sheriff Kowen and his deputies searched in vain for Mamie Blanchard. Roger Verbeck and Muggs drove about in the big roadster continually, watching people, trying to catch a glimpse of some known member of the Black Star's old organization.
<p>The city was gone over, block by block, in an effort to locate the master crook's headquarters, but to no avail. The search extended to the suburbs, but nobody thought of the old farmhouse far up the river near the pleasure resort.
<p>"Well, it's about time we heard from him again!" the chief said to Verbeck on the morning of the third day.
<p>"I look for him to strike to-night," Verbeck said.
<p>"And where do you think he'll strike?"
<p>"That is the puzzle," Verbeck admitted. "I scarcely think he will attempt the museum. It would be a blow to civic pride if he did and succeeded, of course, but the odds would be against him."
<p>"He seems to thrive on odds that are against him," the chief replied.
<p>"Sooner or later, we'll get him!" Verbeck declared. "Sooner or later one of his people will make a slip that will give us the clew we need. They can't keep it up forever."
<p>"But I want to land him right away!" the chief fumed. "Did you happen to read the morning paper? If this sort of thing keeps up, the mayor will be asking for my resignation, and I'll go out of office without having vindicated myself. Confound Kowen, anyway! Why couldn't he keep the crook when he had him? But for Kowen, the Black Star would be doing time in the big prison right now!"
<p>"But he isn't - and it doesn't do any particular good to wail about it," said Verbeck. "The thing to do is to get him again. Made any plans?"
<p>"I'm up in the air!" the chief complained. "What plans can I make? I've got men guarding the museum, and those millionaires' residences, and a few scattered near the jewelry establishments. And I'll hold men ready to go to any section of the city when we get an alarm. That is all I can do. If we knew where he was going to strike - - "
<p>A buzzer sounded, and the chief took up the telephone.
<p>"Hello!" he called.
<p>"That you, chief?"
<p>"Yes."
<p>"Ah, good morning. This is the Black Star! I have tapped a private line again, chief, to have a little chat with you! I've been resting for a couple of days, giving my men and women a holiday. But I'm eager to be busy again!"
<p>"When I get my hands on you - - " the chief began.
<p>"Tut, tut! Why do you always grow violent when I do you the honor of calling you up?"
<p>"Honor? Insult, you mean! We'll get you, and get you good, one of these days!"
<p>"I'll have all the wealth in town if you delay it very long," said the Black Star laughing. "By the way, chief, I'd suggest that you keep a lot of your men at headquarters to-night. You are going to need them."
<p>"Think so?"
<p>"I know it! And I have a faint idea that the newspapers are going to say more naughty things about you to-morrow. That was a pretty grilling the Herald gave you, wasn't it?"
<p>"I'll give you a grilling when I get my hands on you!" the chief said. "So you're going to pull off some sort of a stunt to-night, are you?"
<p>"I am. Inaction bores me, chief. My men are eager to get to work again. They take great pleasure in helping outwit the stupid men on your force."
<p>"We'll see who'll do the final outwitting!" the chief cried. "I'm going to - - "
<p>"Going to get me, I think you said before. Sorry to dispute you, chief, but I can't agree. How do you expect to accomplish it?"
<p>"Tell me one thing," said the chief. "How did you get off that roof, and where did you go?"
<p>"Sorry, but that is a sort of state secret for the present," the Black Star replied.
<p>"Well, if you didn't go down one of the fire escapes, write a letter to the newspapers and say so. They're swearing that you walked right out of that building before our noses."
<p>"All right, chief, I'll inform the papers that I did nothing of the kind. But I'll not explain at this time just what I did do. You see, I might want to do it again soon."
<p>"If you are so blamed sure of your ability, why not tell me what you are going to do to-night?"
<p>"Gladly chief. I am going to collect some jewels and some objects of art."
<p>"Oh, are you?" asked the chief. "Going to collect them in any particular spot?"
<p>"Naturally; but I do not intend to tell you the spot just now. That would be running too much of a risk, I am afraid. By the way, is Mr. Verbeck there?"
<p>"He is!"
<p>"I haven't time to speak to him, but will you kindly tell him for me that I hope he shows more speed in this little duel with me. I was disgusted with him the other evening - he showed no cleverness at all. Tell him that I hope he improves. And now, chief, I must end the conversation for the time being."
<p>There was a click at the other end of the wire. The chief slammed the receiver into its hook and whirled around in his chair.
<p>"Wanted me to tell you to show more cleverness and make the game more interesting, Verbeck," the chief said. "Make it interesting for him if we get the chance, all right! Says he's going to collect jewels and objects of art this evening."
<p>"Then I suppose he'll do it," Verbeck said. "Have your men ready to jump out as soon as the alarm comes in. What is the sheriff doing, chief?"
<p>"Kowen? Sleeping on the job, I suppose. He swears that he and his deputies will catch the Black Star - beat us to it. I had a row with him yesterday at luncheon. Kowen makes me tired! He's looking for that Blanchard woman."
<p>"The Princess? He's not likely to find her," Verbeck said. "Either the Black Star has sent her out of the city, or she is in hiding some place where she'll not be located easily. You can wager that the Black Star takes good care of The Princess - she is one of the most valuable members of his band!"
<p>That afternoon, about the hour of three, an elderly gentleman who looked like a person of culture and refinement, entered the Municipal Museum.
<p>At the information desk, he asked concerning a certain painting, and was directed to the second floor. He thanked the woman at the desk and ascended the stairs, passing the close scrutiny of the guards and the police stationed there. There was nothing to cause suspicion in the appearance of an elderly man who evidently was a lover of art.
<p>He found the painting for which he had asked, and stood before it for some time, looking at it, now stepping forward and now retreating, now and then walking to one side to get a better reflection of light on the canvas.
<p>"Marvelous!" he said, in a thin voice, to one of the attendants. "Such coloring! And such technic!"
<p>"Yes, them old boys knew how to sling the paint," the attendant informed him.
<p>"Sling the paint? What a quaint idiom!" the elderly gentleman remarked and the attendant walked on, calling upon the world to witness that the crop of maniacs was getting larger every year, and that they all visited the museum.
<p>Having inspected that particular picture to his evident satisfaction, the elderly gentleman went through the galleries, viewing other famous paintings. All the attendants and guides noticed him and put him down as a harmless art lover. There was a benevolent appearance about him; he appeared to be the sort of man who makes donations to museums and hospitals.
<p>He finally made his way to the statuary hall. Here, at the time, there was but one guide, and he was handling a group of four tourists. The elderly gentleman gave them scant attention. He adjusted his spectacles and began viewing the statue nearest the door, finished with that and went on to the next, and to the next. The guide and his tourists left the hall - and the elderly gentleman was alone there.
<p>He walked quickly to the other end of the hall, turned and looked back at the door, and made sure that he was not observed by any of the attendants or visitors.
<p>Above his head there was a small trapdoor that opened into the attic of the building. The elderly gentleman betrayed agility remarkable for his years.
<p>He sprang to the nearest window ledge, sprang again and grasped the heavy molding, hung with one hand, and with the other pushed up the trapdoor. Then he pulled himself up and disappeared - and the door was put back in place.
<p>The attic was seldom entered, it appeared. There was nothing at all stored there, and the dust was inches deep everywhere. The elderly gentleman made his way carefully through this dust, obliterating his tracks behind him, and reached a corner of the attic, near a window. Here was a dark space in a gable, large enough to accommodate a hiding man. The elderly gentleman sat down there.
<p>"This will be the death of me!" he growled. "Dust and heat and foul air! I wish the Black Star had picked some one else for this part of the job!"
<p>He took out a handkerchief and tucked it around the edge of his collar, then stretched himself between the rafters.
<p>"Can't smoke - dare not sleep," he grunted. "And it'll be hours before I can get out of here. This is one sweet game I'm playing! But there'll be a handsome profit in it, all right!"
<p>The hours passed. In the big museum below visitors came and went, passing beneath the scrutiny of the guards and the police. Five o'clock came, and the rooms were cleared. Guards searched them well, made sure nobody was inside the building except those who had a right to be there. The custodian and his assistants left. The big doors were locked. Night guards and policemen remained, walking through the rooms. Down in the basement an engineer threw a big electric switch that sent a powerful current through the frames that guarded the priceless objects of art.
<p>Much had been made of that scheme of protection in the newspapers. When that current was turned on, any person touching one of the paintings would be rendered unconscious immediately. Moreover, an alarm would be sounded in the building, another flashed to police headquarters, another to the sheriff's office.
<p>"The Black Star will never tackle this place," said one of the policemen to a guard. "He's going after something else. His gang couldn't get near the building without the men outside spotting them, and we could put up a scrap and keep them out until help came from headquarters."
<p>"I think he'll tackle the private collection of some millionaire," replied the guard. "I don't see how he could hope to get in here and get away with anything."
<p>Outside the building, police paced beats beneath bright lights that illuminated every door and window. Inside, more police and the regular museum guards talked and smoked and wished the long night was over.
<p>Up in the attic, a perspiring elderly gentleman, who was elderly no longer because he had removed a very clever wig, and perspiration had ruined his make-up, looked at the radium dial of his watch and grunted that, at last, the time had come. It was nine o'clock.
<p>He got up and made his way slowly and carefully across the attic through the dust to the trapdoor. He lifted it a fraction of an inch and looked down.
<p>The statuary hall was dark save for a small incandescent light that glowed in the wall near the door. No guard or policeman was in sight, and the door leading to the corridor was closed.
<p>The trapdoor was opened wide, and the man dropped to the floor, making not the slightest sound as he struck. He had removed his shoes in the attic, and had put on a pair of rubbers. He darted behind a statue, and listened, and wiped the perspiration from his face.
<p>Then, running lightly from statue to statue, he made his way toward the corridor door, watching it continually, ready to dart into hiding if it should be opened by guard or policeman.
<p>At the door, he stopped again to listen, and then he turned the knob and opened it cautiously. There was nobody in the corridor as far as he could see in either direction. The guards and policemen, it was evident, were on the floor below.
<p>He took one of the Black Star's vapor guns from his pocket and held it ready. He slipped into the corridor, darted into a niche in the wall, listened again. He could hear two policemen talking on the floor below.
<p>A guard entered the corridor and disappeared into one of the rooms. The man in the niche waited until he came out and started down the hall. The guard passed within three feet of him. The silent vapor gun was discharged, the guard gasped and started to cry out, but unconsciousness claimed him.
<p>The man who had used the vapor gun drew the unconscious guard back into the niche. He used a hypodermic needle on the guard's arm, drugging him so that he would remain senseless for some time to come.
<p>"No need to worry about you for a few hours," he growled.
<p>Still he waited, going to another niche on the other side of the wide corridor. Another guard came from the floor below and started along the hall. He received the same treatment the first guard had received.
<p>Then the man who held the vapor gun hurried through the corridor and came to the head of the wide staircase.
<p>"Ten men inside, and I've taken care of only two of them," he growled. "The boss certainly gave me my share of work to do in this little affair!"
<p>He saw two policemen sitting at the bottom of the stairs. He saw a guard in the distance, another just emerging from one of the rooms on the floor below.
<p>"Where are George and Fred?" he heard the guard ask.
<p>"Went to the second floor," one of the policemen replied.
<p>"Guess I'll go up and help them, and then we won't have to bother about the second floor until early in the morning. Get the card table ready, and we'll have a little game. Nothing to worry about. Looks to me as if the Black Star didn't intend to come here. I guess the boys on the outside would let us know if there was any danger."
<p>The guard started up the stairs, and the man lurking at the top darted into the first niche and crouched there in the semidarkness. The guard passed, the vapor gun was exploded, and the guard toppled forward as had the others, and was drugged as the others had been.
<p>"Seven more, and the engineer," growled the Black Star's man.
<p>Once more he went to the head of the stairs. Four policemen were putting out a collapsible card table. Two guards were approaching along the corridor. The seventh member of the protective squad, the Black Star's man knew, was at the front door, where the officers outside could see him. He was supposed to show himself there at the end of each hour, to let them know that everything was all right inside.
<p>The Black Star's man darted through the corridor and went softly down the rear stairs. He made his way through the hall toward the front. He knew where the light switch was located; he had found this out several days before, when preparing for this night's events.
<p>He reached the switch, jerked it down, and plunged the lower floor in darkness. He darted forward as he heard the exclamations of the six men in front. He dropped behind a statue just as one of the policemen flashed his electric torch.
<p>"Fuse out, I suppose," he heard one of the guards say. "I'll get the engineer - he attends to all that stuff."
<p>He hurried toward the basement entrance. The man at the front door merely shouted to know what was the matter, and remained at his post.
<p>The five others were clustered about the card table. The Black Star's man crept forward and took a vapor bomb from beneath his coat. This was the perilous moment, he knew. This particular bomb was a delicate one that would make no noise as it exploded. But unless the vapor struck into the nostrils of the five men, disaster might come. If one of them escaped unconsciousness for a moment, he would be able to give the alarm.
<p>Another bomb came from beneath the coat. The first one was hurled to the marble floor at the back of the five men. The second followed it.
<p>Clouds of vapor arose. The Black Star's man held a sponge to his nostrils, flashed his torch and watched. It had worked - the five men were staggering - had fallen!
<p>He had swift work to do now. At any moment the guard might return with the engineer, or the other guard come from the front door. He knelt beside the first man, and drove home the point of the needle. He worked in the dark, for it was safer that way. One by one he drugged them, and then he darted noiselessly toward the door that led to the basement.
<p>He was just in time - the guard and engineer were coming up.
<p>"Guess it's a fuse," the guard was saying. "Lights on the upper floor are still burning."
<p>They stepped into the dark corridor, and the guard called for one of the policemen to flash his torch. The Black Star's man stepped up close, and again the vapor gun was discharged. They staggered and fell.
<p>The needle was used again, and then he darted toward the entrance. The guard there had reported to the one outside, and was returning.
<p>"Hurry up with those lights!" he shouted.
<p>He gasped; collapsed. The Black Star's man caught him and let him down to the floor. He was holding the sponge to his nostrils again.
<p>"I'll be going asleep from that vapor myself in a minute, if I'm not careful," he told himself. "I've hardly any more of the stuff. It's a good thing they're all down and out!"
<p>He lifted the unconscious guard and carried him to one side, where he could not be seen from the entrance. Then he ran through the corridor and threw the light switch again, so that those outside would think everything was all right in the interior.
<p>Then he ran to the basement door, hurried down the steps, went to a big electric switch on the wall, and threw that. The deadly protective current was shut off all over the building.
<p>Up the stairs he dashed to the second floor. He hurried to a window on one side of the building, took an electric torch from his pocket and flashed it seven times.
<p>The flashes were observed by a man in a window across the street.
<p>A half a dozen policemen were on guard outside the museum. They walked around the building continually, and communicated at the end of each hour with one of the guards inside. Now and then they gathered near the entrance to talk and wish their vigil was over.
<p>Ten minutes after the Black Star's man had flashed his torch from the window, these six officers were startled by sounds of an altercation in the street. Two men, their voices raised, were quarreling. Others passing in the street stopped to listen. Threats were hurled back and forth. The men grappled, started to fight.
<p>Two of the policemen left the museum and started running toward the combatants. When they were halfway one of the fighting men darted backward, drew a revolver and began firing.
<p>There was a crowd on the corner now. The quarrelsome one continued to shoot; the other man fell in the street.
<p>The four other policemen forgot the museum. They ran toward the corner, clubs in their hands, to beat back the crowd, to help take charge of the murderer, to send for an ambulance, if it proved to be necessary.
<p>The Black Star's man observed this from a window. He flashed his torch again, and then ran down the stairs and to a little side door of the museum, which he unlocked.
<p>Four men darted across the street and through this door. It was locked again immediately.
<p>"All of them down and out!" the man who had been inside reported. "We'll have to work swiftly. They'll be expecting a guard to show his face at the door at the end of the hour. Come with me - I know the paintings the boss wants."
<p>"How about that electric current?" one asked.
<p>"I turned it off, of course. Hurry!"
<p>They ran up the stairs and into one of the galleries. The man who had been inside indicated six paintings. Men crawled beneath the protecting railings, drew knives and started cutting the paintings from their frames.
<p>"No time to waste!" the leader informed them. "We've got about fifteen minutes more."
<p>He ran to one of the windows and glanced out at the street. The crowd was growing larger. The police had ascertained that the man who had fallen was not shot, but had stumbled in his mad haste to get away. The two men had been arrested, and the patrol auto called. None of the police had started back toward the museum, though some of them glanced in that direction now and then.
<p>Inside, the paintings had been cut from their frames and made into rolls. The rolls were tied up with rope and then lashed together.
<p>"Out you go!" said the man who had hidden inside.
<p>They hurried down the stairs and to the little side door. The one ahead opened it and glanced out.
<p>"Coast all clear!" he announced.
<p>Two went first, carrying the roll of paintings with them. The others left one by one, darted across the street, and each went in a different direction. Those with the paintings had an automobile waiting; they jumped in and were driven rapidly away.
<p>The men who had fought were carried away to jail; their part had been done well. The policemen went back to the museum, joking about the fight they had witnessed.
<p>"They'll make it up in the morning and get fined for fighting and discharging firearms," one of them declared. "Business quarrel, eh? Pretty vigorous business men, I think!"
<p>"Suppose everything's all right inside?" another asked.
<p>"That gang inside is so busy playing cards that they wouldn't know it if a battle was staged in the street."
