Then stood erect looked body I followed gaze I noted attitude accurately I done first shock discovering It lying right side half stomach right arm doubled left hand clutching floor head The knee drawn though convulsion face horribly contorted sort purple tinge skin though blood suddenly congealed The eye wide open glassy stare added little apparent terror suffering face It pleasant sight moment I turned eye away shiver repugnance The coroner glanced Simmonds `` Not much question cause '' said `` Poison course '' `` Of course '' nodded Simmonds `` But kind '' asked Godfrey `` It take post-mortem tell '' Goldberger bent another close look distorted face `` I 'm free admit symptom n't usual one '' Godfrey shrugged shoulder `` I say '' agreed turned away inspection room `` What tell

Goldberger asked `` Only call merely pretext man really looking place could kill unobserved '' `` How long time elapsed Parks announced man Mr. Vantine came downstairs '' `` Half hour perhaps '' Goldberger nodded `` Let 's Parks '' said I opened door called Parks sitting bottom step stair Goldberger looked carefully stepped room could two opinion Parks He Vantine eight ten year earmark

looked door opening another room beyond examined fastening window ended looking minutely carpet `` What room yonder used '' asked Godfrey pointing connecting door `` It 's sort store-room sir '' said Parks `` Mr. Vantine back Europe 've unpacking thing bought abroad '' `` I guess 's '' said Goldberger moment `` Send Mr. Vantine please '' Parks went Vantine came moment later He corroborated exactly story told Parks added one detail `` Here man 's card '' said held square pasteboard Goldberger took card glanced passed Simmonds `` That n't tell u much '' said latter gave card Godfrey I looked shoulder saw contained single engraved line '' Except 's French Parks suggested '' said Godfrey `` That 's evident cut clothes '' `` Yes cut hair '' added Goldberger `` You say n't know Mr Vantine '' `` I never saw knowledge '' answered Vantine `` The name wholly unknown '' `` Well '' said Goldberger taking possession card slipping pocket `` suppose lift onto couch window take look clothes '' The man slightly built Simmonds Goldberger raised body without difficulty placed couch I saw Godfrey 's eye searching carpet `` What I like know '' said moment `` fellow took poison take Where 's paper

`` See '' said Simmonds `` something bit '' pointed two deep incision back hand knuckle drop blood oozed dried With little exclamation surprise excitement Godfrey bent instant injured hand Then turned looked u `` This man n't take poison '' said low voice `` He killed '' `` He killed '' repeated Godfrey conviction word drew together little shiver repulsion Death awesome enough time suicide add horror murder give final touch So stood silent staring though fascinated hand Simmonds held u tiny wound encircled discoloured flesh sinister dash clotted blood running away Then Goldberger taking deep breath voiced thought sprung brain `` Why look like snake-bite '' said voice sharp astonishment And indeed Those two tiny incision scarcely half inch apart might well made serpent 's fang The quick glance u cast room course involuntary chill ran spine yet Godfrey I yes Simmonds excuse upon time encounter deadly snake none u likely ever forget We smiled little sheepishly caught 's eye `` No I n't think snake '' said Godfrey bent close hand `` Smell Mr. Goldberger '' added The coroner put nose close hand sniffed `` Bitter almond '' said `` Which mean prussic acid '' said Godfrey `` snake poison '' He fell silent moment eye swollen hand The rest u stared I suppose others labouring I effort find thread theory amid chaos `` It might course self-inflicted '' Godfrey added quite Goldberger sneered little No doubt found incomprehensibility problem rather trying temper `` A man n't usually commit suicide sticking hand fork '' said `` No '' agreed Godfrey blandly `` I would point n't know yet case suicide I 'm quite sure whatever may n't usual '' Goldberger 's sneer deepened `` Did reporter Record ever find case usual '' queried It shrewd thrust one Godfrey might well winced For Record

disease '' Goldberger nodded approval Godfrey smiled looked `` It 's easy find explanation n't '' queried `` It 's blamed sight easier find natural simple explanation '' retorted Goldberger hotly `` find unnatural far-fetched one one man could kill another scratching hand I suppose think fellow murdered That 's said minute ago '' `` Perhaps I little hasty '' Godfrey admitted I suspected whatever thought made mind keep `` I 'm going theorise I 've got something start The fact seem point suicide swallowed prussic acid 's bottle He n't swallow '' `` Maybe 'll find clothes '' suggested Simmonds Thus reminded Goldberger fell work looking dead man 's pocket The clothes cheap material new life must presented appearance somewhat shabby There purse inside coat pocket containing two bill one ten

presently No doubt I working hard I needed vacation well I would take it… And time I knew nightmare grim reality Philip Vantine dead killed woman Who told And I remembered sobbing voice… Two three person came room Parks servant I suppose I heard Godfrey 's voice giving order finally someone held glass lip commanded drink I mechanically coughed spluttered conscious grateful warmth drank eagerly And I saw Godfrey standing `` Feel better '' asked I nodded `` I n't wonder knocked '' went `` I 'm feeling shaky I call Vantine 's physician ca n't anything '' `` He 's dead '' I murmured eye dark crumpled object Philip Vantine `` Yes like '' Then I remembered I caught arm drew `` Godfrey '' I whispered `` whose voice I dream something woman '' `` You n't dream Rogers 's almost hysterical We

body assured life fled Then I heard Godfrey telling knew Hughes listened incredulous face `` But 's absurd know '' protested Godfrey finished `` Things like n't happen New York In Florence perhaps Middle Ages twentieth century '' `` I scarcely believe sens '' Godfrey agreed `` But I saw Frenchman lying afternoon 's Vantine '' `` On spot '' `` As nearly I tell '' `` And killed way '' `` Killed precisely way '' Hughes turned back body looked long earnestly injured hand `` What sort instrument made wound would say Mr Godfrey '' questioned last `` A sharp instrument two prong My theory prong

`` That 's reason two I fancy '' `` But course aware poison exists would act quickly '' Hughes inquired Godfrey looked strangely `` You mentioned Florence moment ago '' said `` You meant I suppose poison one time exist '' `` Something sort perhaps '' agreed Hughes `` The word purely instinctive I suppose thought running head '' `` Well poison existed Florence five century ago exists to-day There 's proof '' Godfrey pointed body Hughes drew deep breath wonder horror `` But sort devilish instrument '' cried nerve giving way instant voice mounting shrilly `` Above wields '' He stared room though half-expecting see mighty remorseless arm poised ready strike Then shook together `` I beg pardon '' said mopping sweat face `` I 'm used sort thing I 'm frightened yes I really believe I 'm

supernatural something I ca n't understand How happen victim struck right hand Why left hand Why hand '' Godfrey answered despairing shrug `` That 've got find '' said `` We shall call police '' suggested Hughes `` Maybe solve '' Godfrey smiled little sceptical smile quickly suppressed `` At least given chance '' agreed `` Shall I attend '' `` Yes '' said Hughes `` would better right away The sooner get better '' `` Very well '' assented Godfrey left room Hughes sat heavily couch near window mopped face shaking hand Death accustomed death met decently bed resulting understood cause Death

answered Grady 's question clearly concisely He told first event afternoon passed evening `` Mr. Vantine dinner home sir '' said `` It served I think seven o'clock He must finished little seven-thirty

eye blood-shot staring He reeled rather walked room one hand clutching throat though choking `` Get chair '' said Grady Simmonds brought one forward remained standing beside `` Now man '' Grady continued `` 'll brace What 's matter anyhow Did n't ever see dead man '' `` It ai n't '' gasped Rogers `` It ai n't though I never saw murdered man '' `` What '' demanded Grady sharply `` Did n't see

took flask pocket opened `` Take drink '' said placed Rogers 's hand I could hear mouth flask clattering teeth put eagerly mouth took three four long swallow `` Thank sir '' said steadily handed flask back owner A little colour crept face I fancied new look eye horror faded fear took place Grady screwed cap flask great deliberation returned pocket And time Rogers watching furtively wiping mouth mechanically trembling hand `` Now Rogers '' Grady began `` I want take time tell u detail everything happened to-night You say woman Well want hear woman Now go ahead remember 's hurry '' `` Well sir

white behind veil I could see red lip I n't like look sir first '' `` How dressed '' `` In dark gown sir cut skimpy I knowed French spoke '' `` Ah '' said Grady `` She French '' `` Yes sir though

`` Maybe n't latched '' suggested Grady `` It snap-lock sir woman slammed shut I heard catch '' `` You 're sure '' `` Quite sure sir '' `` What '' `` I closed door sir come back along hall I felt

dead Why n't try help '' `` One look enough tell n't use '' said Rogers glanced visible horror crumpled form floor Grady looked keenly moment seemed reason doubt story Then detective looked room `` There 's one thing I n't understand '' said `` Vantine want light What '' `` I could n't sure sir I suppose looking furniture brought Europe He collector know sir There five six piece next room '' Without word Grady arose passed room adjoining Rogers remained seated I remember glancing back shoulder noting huddled forward chair though crushed great weight instant back turned But I forgot Rogers contemplation scene The inner room ablaze light furniture stood hap-hazard I seen earlier day Only one thing moved That Boule cabinet It carried centre room placed full glare light chandelier It stood blazing arrogant beauty thing apart Who helped Vantine place I wondered Neither Rogers Parks mentioned I turned back outer room Rogers sitting crouched forward chair hand eye I could feel jerk nervousness I touched shoulder `` Oh Mr Lester '' gasped `` Pardon sir I 'm sir '' `` I see '' I said soothingly `` wonder I wanted ask help move furniture room yonder '' `` Help move sir '' `` Yes help change position since afternoon '' `` No sir I n't touched sir '' `` That 's right '' I said turned back inner room Vantine said intended examining cabinet detail first opportunity I remembered eye gleamed looked hand trembled caressed arabesque No doubt making examination heard woman 's cry gone hall see matter Then woman entered ante-room together closed door then… Like lightning-flash thought leaped brain reason explanation wild improbable absurd still explanation I choked back cry rose lip I gripped hand behind desperate attempt hold check fascinated deadly serpent I stood staring cabinet For I felt certain lay clue mystery Grady Simmonds Goldberger examined room minutely seemed feel secret tragedy lay somewhere within four wall I watched absently I lost interest procedure I perfectly sure would find nothing way bearing upon mystery I heard Grady comment upon fact door except one opening ante-room saw examine window-catches `` Nobody could raise window without alarming house '' Grady said pointed tiny wire running along woodwork `` There 's burglar alarm '' Simmonds assented finally trio returned ante-room `` We 'd like look rest house '' Grady said Rogers sitting erect looking like four men went hall together I remained behind Hughes Freylinghuisen They lifted body couch making careful examination Heavy heart I sat near watched That Philip Vantine killed enthusiasm hobby given much pleasure seemed irony fate yet I believed case To sure various incident seemed conflict theory theory seemed wild point absurdity least ray light utter darkness I turned mind trying fit happening day I must confess poor success Freylinghuisen 's voice brought reverie `` The two case precisely alike '' saying `` The symptom identical And I 'm certain shall find paralysis heart spinal cord case I Both men killed poison '' `` Can make guess nature poison '' Hughes inquired `` Some variant hydrocyanic acid I fancy odour indicates must fifty time deadly hydrocyanic acid '' They wandered away discussion possible variant technical be-sprinkled abstruse word formula I could follow Freylinghuisen course sort thing finger end post-mortem every-day occupation doubt furbishing since last one preparation inquest would naturally wish shine I could see enjoyed displaying knowledge Hughes although family practitioner high standing income greater Freylinghuisen 's many time expert knowledge toxicology coroner 's physician would naturally posse The two detective coroner came back discussion still progress listened silence Freylinghuisen 's statement case Grady 's mahogany face told absolutely nothing passing brain Simmonds plainly bewildered It evident look nothing found shed light mystery suicide theory fallen piece completely sea So I suspected Grady self-composed betray The coroner drew two physician aside talked moment low tone Then turned Grady `` Freylinghuisen think necessity post-mortem '' said `` The symptom every way identical man killed afternoon There question died cause He ready make return effect '' `` Very well '' assented Grady `` The body turned relative '' `` There n't relative '' I said `` least near one Vantine last branch family I happen know firm named executor objection I 'll take charge thing '' `` Very well Mr. Lester '' said Grady looked `` Do know provision '' asked `` I '' `` In light provision know one would interest Vantine 's death '' `` I think I may tell provision '' I said moment `` With exception legacy servant whole fortune left Metropolitan Museum Art '' `` You attorney time '' `` We legal adviser many year '' `` Have ever learned enemy '' `` No '' I answered instantly `` far I know enemy earth '' `` He never married I believe '' `` No '' `` Was ever knowledge involved woman '' `` No '' I said `` I astounded I heard Rogers 's story '' `` So give u hint woman 's identity '' `` I wish I could '' I said fervour `` Thank Mr. Lester '' Grady turned Simmonds `` I n't see anything '' added `` There 's one thing though Mr. Lester I ask That keep servant inquest If think doubt ability course put arrest `` '' Oh n't necessary '' I broke `` I responsible appearance inquest '' `` I 'll postpone day '' said Goldberger `` I want Freylinghuisen make test to-morrow Besides 've got identify d'Aurelle gentleman seem work cut finding woman `` Grady looked Goldberger way indicated thought talking much coroner stopped abruptly A moment later four men left house Dr. Hughes lingered last word `` The undertaker better called '' said `` It wo n't delay long '' I knew meant Already face dead man showing certain ugly discolouration `` I send around way home '' added I thanked assuming unpleasant duty As door closed behind I heard step stair turned see Godfrey calmly descending `` I came minute ago '' explained answer look `` glancing around upstairs Nothing How friend Grady get along '' `` Fairly well guess anything face n't show '' `` His face never show anything 's nothing show He cultivated sibylline look people think 's wonder But 's simply stupid ignoramus '' `` Oh come Godfrey '' I protested `` 're prejudiced He went right point Do know Rogers 's story '' `` About woman Certainly Rogers told Grady arrived '' `` Well '' I commented `` n't lose time '' `` I never '' assented blandly `` And I 'm going prove Grady merely stupid ignoramus He heard evidence know woman '' `` Of course '' I said I looked `` Do mean Then I 'm ignoramus '' `` My dear Lester '' protested Godfrey `` detective 's business Grady 's At least supposed safety city place residence depends le upon truth assumption On strength made deputy police commissioner charge detective bureau '' `` Then mean know '' `` I 'm pretty sure I I came back prove Where 's Rogers '' `` I 'll ring '' I said presently appeared `` Did ring sir '' asked He still miserably nervous much self-controlled earlier evening `` Yes '' I said `` Mr. Godfrey wish speak '' It seemed Rogers turned visibly paler certainly fear glance turned upon companion But Godfrey smiled reassuringly `` We 'd better give instruction reporter first thing n't Lester '' inquired `` Which reporter '' I queried `` All others course They storming house Rogers long You meet door refuse admit one tell nothing learned must go police Tell Commissioner Grady charge case doubt glad talk Is right Lester '' `` Yes Ulysses '' I agreed smiling `` And '' continued Godfrey watching Rogers keenly `` I photograph I want look Did ever see person '' handed print Rogers The latter hesitated instant took print trembling hand Stark fear eye slowly raised print light glanced it… `` Catch Lester '' Godfrey cried sprang forward For Rogers clutching wildly collar spun half around fell crash Godfrey 's arm broke fall somewhat I dazed move `` Get water quick '' Godfrey commanded sharply Parks came running `` Rogers taken ill. '' And Parks sped hall I saw Godfrey loosen collar unconscious man begin chafe temple fiercely `` I hope n't apoplexy '' muttered `` I ought n't shocked like '' At word I remembered stooping picked photograph fluttered Rogers 's nerveless finger And I uttered smothered exclamation I gazed dark eye full lip oval face face d'Aurelle carried watch But n't apoplexy It Parks reassured u came hurrying back minute later glass water one hand small phial `` He spell '' said `` It 's kind vertigo Give whiff '' He uncorked phial handed Godfrey I caught penetrating fume ammonia A moment later Rogers gasped convulsively `` He 'll right pretty soon '' remarked Parks ready optimism `` Though I never saw quite bad '' `` We ca n't leave lying floor '' said Godfrey `` There 's couch-seat music-room '' Parks suggested three u bore still unconscious man Then Godfrey I sat waited gasped way back life `` Though ca n't really tell u much '' Godfrey observed `` In fact I doubt 'll willing tell anything But face looked picture told u need know '' Thus reminded I took photograph pocket I slipped looked `` Where get '' I asked `` The police photographer made copy This one '' `` But made suspect two woman '' `` I n't know '' answered Godfrey reflectively `` They French Rogers spoke red lip somehow seemed probable Mr. Grady find thing n't know to-morrow 's Record But usually This time I 'm going rub Hello '' added `` friend coming around '' I looked Rogers saw eye open They staring u though wondering Godfrey passed arm head held glass water lip `` Take swallow '' said Rogers obeyed mechanically still staring rim glass `` How feel '' `` Pretty weak '' Rogers answered almost whisper `` Did I fit '' `` Something like '' said Godfrey cheerfully `` n't worry You 'll soon right '' `` What sent '' asked Rogers stared Then face turned purple I thought going But moment 's heavy breathing lay quiet `` I remember '' said `` Let see picture '' I passed His hand trembling could hardly take I saw struggling desperately control managed hold picture eye look apparent unconcern `` Do know '' Godfrey asked To infinite amazement Rogers shook head `` Never saw '' muttered `` When I first looked I thought I knew ai n't woman '' `` Do mean say '' Godfrey demanded sternly `` woman called Mr. Vantine to-night '' Again Rogers shook head `` Oh '' protested `` 's woman This one younger '' Godfrey made reply sat looked Rogers Rogers lay gazed picture gradually face softened though tender memory `` Come Rogers '' I urged last `` You 'd better tell u know If woman n't hesitate say '' `` I 've told I know Mr. Lester '' said Rogers meet eye `` And I 'm feeling pretty bad I think I 'd better getting bed '' `` Yes 's best '' agreed Godfrey promptly `` Parks help '' held hand photograph Rogers relinquished evident reluctance He opened lip though ask question closed got slowly foot Parks aiding `` Good-night gentleman '' said weakly shuffled away leaning heavily Parks 's shoulder `` Well '' said I looking Godfrey `` What think '' `` He 's lying course We 've got find 's lying bring home But 's getting late I must get office One word Lester sure Rogers n't give slip '' `` I 'll looked '' I promised `` But I fancy 'll afraid run away Besides possible 's telling truth I n't believe woman anything either death '' Godfrey turned starting away stopped look `` Who '' asked `` Nobody '' `` You mean suicided abnormal way '' `` No n't suicide killed human least directly '' I felt I floundering hopelessly stopped `` I ca n't tell Godfrey '' I pleaded `` I n't time think You 've got enough one day '' `` Yes '' smiled `` I 've got enough one day And good-bye Perhaps I 'll look midnight way home I get '' I sighed Godfrey 's energy became little wearing sometimes I already longing bed remained much done But day I knew hard one many-column story still write apparently fresh eager ever `` All right '' I agreed `` If see light come If n't light I 'll bed I 'll kill wake '' `` Conditions accepted '' laughed I opened door Parks joined I turned back house `` I got Rogers bed sir '' said `` He 'll right morning But 's queer duck '' `` How long known Parks '' `` He 's Mr. Vantine five year I n't know much 's silent kind fellow keeping hisself good deal sort brooding thing But work right except keeled like to-night '' `` Parks '' I said suddenly `` I 'm going ask question You know Mr. Vantine friend mine I thought great deal Now story Rogers tell one two thing talk woman Is foundation talk kind '' `` No sir '' said Parks emphatically `` I 've Mr. Vantine 's valet eight year time never mixed woman shape form I always fancied 'd loved lady died I n't know made think anyhow since I 've known never looked woman way '' `` Thank Parks '' I said sigh relief `` I 've much to-day I felt I could n't endure `` '' Beg pardon sir '' said voice elbow `` everything ready sir '' I turned start see little clean-shaven man standing rubbing hand softly together gazing blandly `` The undertaker 's assistant sir '' explained Parks seeing look astonishment `` He came Mr. Godfrey music-room Dr. Hughes sent '' `` Yes sir '' added little man `` corpse ready coffin Very nice look though hard job Was poison killed sir '' `` Yes '' I answered feeling nausea `` poison '' `` Very powerful poison I say sir n't get none soon Where shall put body sir '' `` Why leave '' I asked impatiently `` Very good sir '' said man presently assistant took intense relief `` And Parks '' I began `` something I want say Let u go somewhere sit '' `` Suppose go study sir You 're looking regularly done 'll permit say sir Shall I get something '' `` A brandy-and-soda '' I assented `` bring one '' `` Very good sir '' minute later sitting opposite room Vantine offered similar refreshment many hour I looked Parks sat turned mind I say I liked man I felt could trusted At rate I take risk `` Now Parks '' I began setting glass `` I say serious I want keep I know devoted Mr. Vantine I may well tell remembered I sure willing anything power help solve mystery death '' `` That I sir '' Parks agreed warmly `` I fond sir nobody miss I '' I realised tragedy meant far Parks even lost friend mean livelihood I looked heightened sympathy `` I know feel '' I said `` I counting help I sort idea death came Only vaguest possible idea '' I added hastily eye widened interest `` altogether vague put word But I say much mystery whatever ante-room body found room next furniture Now I going lock room I want see nobody enters without knowledge '' `` Not likely anybody want enter sir '' Parks

`` Trust sir '' said Parks promptly `` What want '' `` I want put cot hallway outside door ante-room sleep to-night To-morrow I decide precaution necessary '' `` Very good sir '' said Parks `` I 'll

`` Yes '' I agreed `` Vantine '' `` Vantine 's death n't simply explained Presumably unknown woman also called business relating cabinet She also wanted open secret drawer order secure content seems
