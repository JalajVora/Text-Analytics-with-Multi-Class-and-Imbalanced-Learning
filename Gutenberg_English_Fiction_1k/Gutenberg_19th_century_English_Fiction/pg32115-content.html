<p>Madam Fulton and her granddaughter Electra were sitting at the breakfast-table. It was a warm yet inspiriting day in early spring, and, if the feel and look of it were not enough, the garden under the dining-room windows told the season's hour like a floral clock. The earliest blossoms had been pushed onward by the mounting spirit of the year, and now the firstlings of May were budding. The great Georgian house, set in the heart of this processional bloom, showed the mellow tints of time. It had an abundant acreage, diversified, at first hand, not only by this terraced garden in the rear, but by another gone to wild abandon on the west, and an orchard stretching away into level fields and, beyond them, groves of pine.
<p>These dining-room windows, three of them, side by side, and now unshaded, gave large outlook on a beautiful and busy world where the terrace mounted in green, to be painted later with red peony balls, and where the eye, still traveling, rested in satisfaction on the fringe of locusts at the top.
<p>Inside the house the sense of beauty could be fully fed. Here was a sweet consistency, the sacred past in untouched being, that time when furniture was made in England, and china was the product of long voyages and solemn hoarding in corner cabinets with diamond panes. Life here was reflected dimly from polished surfaces and serenely accentuated by quaint carvings and spindle legs. Here was "atmosphere" - the theatre of simple and austere content.
<p>Madam Fulton outwardly fitted her background as a shepherdess fits a fan. She was a sprite of an old lady, slender and round, and finished in every movement, with the precision of those who have "learned the steps" in dancing of another period. It was her joy that she had kept her figure, her commonplace that, having it, she knew what to do with it. She had a piquant profile, dark eyes, and curls whiter than white, sifted over with the lustre of a living silver. According to her custom, she wore light gray, and there was lace about her wrists and throat.
<p>"Coffee, Electra?" she suddenly proposed, in a contralto voice that still had warmth in it. She put the question impatiently, as if her hidden self and that of the girl opposite had been too long communing, in spite of them, and she had to break the tacit bondage of that intercourse by one more obvious. The girl looked up from the letter in her hand.
<p>"No, thank you, grandmother," she said. Her voice, even in its lowest notes, had a clear, full resonance. Then she laid the letter down. "I beg your pardon," she added. "I thought you were opening your mail."
<p>"No! no!" Madam Fulton cried, in a new impatience. "Go on. Read your letter. Don't mind me."
<p>But the girl was pushing it aside. She looked across the table with her direct glance, and Madam Fulton thought unwillingly how handsome she was. Electra was young, and she lacked but one thing: a girl's uncertain grace. She had all the freshness of youth with the poise of ripest womanhood. She sat straight and well, and seemed to manage her position at table as if it were a horse. Her profile was slightly aquiline and her complexion faultless in its fairness and its testimony to wholesome living. Her lips were rather thin, but the line of white teeth behind them showed exquisitely. She had a great deal of fine brown hair wound about her head in braids, in an imperial fashion. Perhaps the only fault in her face was that her eyes were of a light and not sympathetic blue.
<p>"Shall I open your mail, grandmother?" she asked with extreme deference.
<p>Madam Fulton's hand was lying on a disordered pile of letters, twenty deep, beside her plate. She pressed the hand a little closer.
<p>"No, thank you," she said. "I will attend to them myself."
<p>Electra laid down her napkin, and pushed her plate to one side, to give space for her own papers. She lifted one sheet, and holding it in her fine hands, began rather elegantly, -
<p>"Grandmother, I have here a most interesting letter from Mrs. Furnivall Williams. She speaks of your book in the highest praise."
<p>"Oh!" said the old lady, with a shade of satire, "does she? That's very good-natured of Fanny Williams."
<p>"Let me read you what she says." Electra bent a frowning brow upon the page. "Ah, this is it. 'It was to be expected that your grandmother would write what we all wanted to read. But her "Recollections" are more than welcome. They are satisfying. They are illuminative.'"
<p>"Fanny Williams is a fool!"
<p>Electra, not glancing up, yet managed to look deeply pained.
<p>"She goes on to say, 'What a power your dear grandmother has been! I never realized it until now.'"
<p>"That's a nasty thing for Fanny Williams to write. You tell her so."
<p>"Then she asks whether you would be willing to meet the Delta Club for an afternoon of it."
<p>"Of what?"
<p>"Your book, grandmother, - your 'Recollections.'"
<p>"Electra, you drive me to drink. I have written the book. I've printed it. I've done with it. What does Fanny Williams want me to do now? Prance?"
<p>Electra was looking at her grandmother at last and in a patient hopefulness, like one awaiting a better mood.
<p>"Grandmother dear," she protested, "it almost seems as if you owe it to the world, having said so much, to say a little more."
<p>"What, for instance, Electra? What?"
<p>Electra considered, one hand smoothing out the page.
<p>"People want to know things about it. The newspapers do. How can you think for a moment of the discussion there has been, and not expect questions?"
<p>The old lady smiled to herself.
<p>"Well," she said, "they won't find out."
<p>"But why, grandmother, why?"
<p>"I can't tell you why, Electra; but they won't, and there's an end of it." She rose from her chair, and Electra, gathering her mail, followed punctiliously. As they were leaving the room, her grandmother turned upon her. "Did you hear from Peter?" she asked.
<p>"Yes. From New York. He will be here to-morrow." Electra's clear, well-considered look was very unlike that of a girl whose lover had come home, after a five years' absence, for the avowed purpose of marriage.
<p>Madam Fulton regarded her for a moment with a softened glance. It seemed wistfully to include other dreams, other hopes than the girl's own, a little dancing circle of shadowy memories outside the actual, as might well happen when one has lived many years and seen the growth and passing of such ties.
<p>"Well, Electra," she said then, "I suppose you'll marry him. You'll be famous by brevet. That's what you'll like."
<p>Electra laughed a little, in a tolerant way.
<p>"You are always thinking I want to become a celebrity, grandmother," she said. "That's very funny of you."
<p>"Think!" emphasized the old lady. "I know it. I know your kind. They're thick as spatter now. Everybody wants to do something, or say he's done it. You want to 'express' yourselves. That's what you say - 'express' yourselves. I never saw such a race."
<p>She went grumbling into the library to answer her letters, or at least look them through, and paused there for a moment, her hand on the table. She knew approximately what was in the letters. They were all undoubtedly about her book, the "Recollections" of her life, some of them questioning her view of the public events therein narrated, but others palpitating with an eager interest. She had written that history as a woman of letters in a small way, and a woman who had known the local celebrities, and she had done it so vividly, with such incredible originality, that the book was not only having a rapid sale, but it piqued the curiosity of gossip-lovers and even local historians. No names were mentioned; but when she wrote, "A poet said to me in Cambridge one day," everybody knew what poet was meant. When she obscurely alluded to the letters preceding some smooth running of the underground railway, historians of the war itched to see the letters, and invited her to produce them. The book was three months old now, and the wonder no less. The letters had been coming, and the old lady had not been answering them. At first she read them with glee, as a later chapter of her life story; but now they tired her a little, because she anticipated their appeal.
<p>A bird was singing outside. She cocked her head a little and listened, not wholly in pleasure, but with a critical curiosity as well. She was always watching for the diminution of sound, the veiling of sight because she was old, and now she wondered whether the round golden notes were what they had been fifty years ago. She stood a moment thoughtfully, her hand now on the letters, - those tedious intruders upon her leisure. Then, with an air of guilty escape, though there was no one to see and judge, she left them lying there and stole softly out on the veranda, where she sank into her friendly wicker chair, and looking upon the world, smilingly felt it to be good. The sky was very bright, yet not too bright for pleasure; clouds not meant for rain were blotting it in feathery spaces. There was a sweet air stirring, and the birds, though they were busy, said something about it from time to time in a satisfactory way. Madam Fulton felt the rhythm and surge of it all, and acquiesced in her own inactive part in it. Sometimes of late she hardly knew how much of life was memory and how much the present brilliant call of things. It was life, the thing she did not understand. Presently she closed her eyes and sank, she thought, into a deeper reverie. These excursions of hers were less like sleep, she always told herself, than a kind of musing dream. At last she was learning what other old people had meant when they explained, with a shamefaced air of knowing youth could never understand, "I just lost myself." To lose one's battered and yet still insistent self was now to be at peace.
<p>When the forenoon was an hour or more along, she opened her eyes, aware of some one looking at her. There he was, an old gentleman of a pleasant aspect, heavy, with a thickness of curling white hair, blue eyes, and that rosiness which is as the bloom upon the flower of good living. His clothes were of the right cut, and he wore them with the ease of a man who has always had the best to eat, to wear, to look at; for whom life has been a well-organized scheme to turn out comfort. The old lady stared at him with unwinking eyes, and the old gentleman smiled at her.
<p>"Billy!" she cried at last, and gave him both her hands. "Billy Stark!"
<p>They shook hands warmly and still looked each other in the eye. They had not met for years, and neither liked to think what was in the other's mind. But Madam Fulton, after they had sat down, challenged it.
<p>"I'm an old woman, Billy." She wrinkled up her eyes in a delightful way she had. "Don't you think that's funny?"
<p>Billy with difficulty crossed one leg over the other, helping it with a plump hand.
<p>"You're precisely what you always were."
<p>His round, comfortable voice at once put her where she liked to be, in the field of an unconsidered intercourse with man. Electra, she knew, was too much with her, but she had forgotten how invigorating these brisk yet kindly breezes were, from the other planets. "That's what I came over to see about," Billy was saying, with a rakish eye. "I needn't have taken the trouble. You're as little changed as that syringa bush."
<p>Her brilliant face softened into something wistful.
<p>"The bush will come into bloom in a few weeks, Billy," she reminded him. "I shan't ever bloom again."
<p>"Boo to a goose!" said Billy. "You're in bloom now."
<p>The wistfulness was gone. She adjusted her glasses on her nose and eyed him sharply.
<p>"I think too much about old age," she said. "I regard mine as a kind of mildew, and every day and forty times a day I peer at myself to see if the mildew's growing thicker. But you don't seem to have any mildew, Billy. You're just a different kind of person from what you were fifty years ago. You haven't gone bad at all."
<p>Billy set his correct feet together on the floor, rose, and, with his hand on his heart, made her a bow.
<p>"I don't care for it much myself," he said.
<p>"Growing old? It's the devil, Billy. Don't talk about it. Why aren't you in England?"
<p>"I'm junior partner now."
<p>"I know it."
<p>"I'm a great publisher, Florrie."
<p>She nodded.
<p>"Your men run over to arrange with us in London. There was no occasion for my coming here. But I simply wanted to. I got a little curious - homesick, maybe. So I came. Got in last night. I read your book before I sailed."
<p>She looked at him quizzically and almost, it might be said, with a droll uneasiness.
<p>"You brought it out in England," she offered, in rather a small voice. "Naturally you'd read it."
<p>"Not because we brought it out. Because it was yours," he corrected her. "My word, Florrie, what a life you've had of it."
<p>The pink crept into her cheeks. Her eyes menaced him.
<p>"Are you trying to pump me, Billy Stark?" she inquired.
<p>"Not for a moment. But you're guilty, Florrie. What is it?"
<p>She considered, her gaze bent on her lap.
<p>"Well, the fact is, Billy," she temporized, "I've got in pretty deep with that book. I wrote it as a sort of a - well, I wrote it, you know, and I thought I might get a few hundred dollars out of it, same as I have out of those novels I used to write to keep lace on my petticoats. Well! the public has made a fool of itself over the book. Every day I get piles of letters asking what I meant by this and that, and won't I give my documentary evidence for saying this or that great gun did so and so at such a time."
<p>"Well, why don't you?"
<p>"Give my evidence? Why, I can't!" She was half whimpering, with a laugh on her old face. "I haven't got it."
<p>"You mean you haven't the actual letters now. Those extraordinary ones of the abolitionist group, for example, - can't you produce them?"
<p>"Why no, Billy, of course I can't. I" - she held his glance with a mixture of deprecation and a gay delight - "I made them up."
<p>William Stark, the publisher, looked at her with round blue eyes growing rounder and a deeper red surging into his sea-tanned face. He seemed on the point of bursting into an explosion, whether of horror or mirth Madam Fulton could not tell. She continued to gaze at him in the same mingling of deprecating and amused inquiry. In spite of her years she looked like a little animal which, having done wrong, seeks out means of propitiation, and as yet knows nothing better than the lifted eyebrow of inquiry.
<p>"Well," she said again defiantly, "I made them up."
<p>"In God's name, Florrie, what for?"
<p>"I wanted to."
<p>"To pad out your book?"
<p>"To make a nice book, the kind of one I wanted. I'll tell you what, Billy," - she bowled caution into the farthest distance, - "I'm going to make a clean breast of it. Now you won't peach?"
<p>He shook his head.
<p>"Go on," he bade her.
<p>She lifted her head, sat straighter in her chair, and spoke with firmness: -
<p>"Now, Billy, if I'm going to talk to you at all, you must know precisely where I stand. Maybe you do, but I don't believe it. You see, all these years I've been writing what I called novels, and they've paid me a little, and I've got up a sort of local fame. I'm as poor - well, I can't tell you how poor. Only I live here in the summer with Electra in her house - "
<p>"It's the old Fulton house."
<p>"Yes, but it came to her through her father. Remember, I was a second wife. I had no children. My husband gave me the Cambridge place and left this to his son."
<p>"What became of the Cambridge house?"
<p>"Sold, years ago. Eaten up. Seems as if I'd done nothing, all these years, but eat. It makes me sick to think of it. Well, here was I, credit low, my little knack at writing all but gone - why, Billy, styles have changed since my day. Folks would hoot at my novels now. They don't read them. They just remember I wrote them when they want a celebrity at a tea. I'm a back number. Don't you know it?"
<p>He nodded, gravely pondering. The one thing about him never to be affected by his whimsical humor was the integrity of a business verdict. Madam Fulton now was warming to the value of her own position. She began to see how picturesque it was.
<p>"Well, then up rises one of your precious publishers and says to me, 'Mrs. Fulton, you have known all the celebrated people. Why not write your recollections?' 'Why not?' says I. Well, I went home and sat down and wrote. And when I looked back at my life, I found it dull. So I gave myself a free hand. I described the miserable thing as it ought to have been, not as it was."
<p>William Stark was leaning forward, looking her in the face, his hands on his knees, as if to steady him through an amazing crisis.
<p>"Florrie," he began, "do you mean to say you made up most of the letters in that book?"
<p>"Most of them? Every one! I hadn't any letters from celebrities. Days when I might have had, I didn't care a button about the eggs they were cackling over, and I didn't know they were going to be celebrities, then, did I?"
<p>"Do you mean the recollections of Brook Farm, taken down from the lips of the old poet as he had it from a member of the fraternity there - "
<p>"Faked, dear boy, faked, every one of them." She was gathering cheerfulness by the way.
<p>"The story of Hawthorne and the first edition - "
<p>"Hypothetical. Grouse in the gun-room."
<p>"Do you mean that the story of the old slave who came to your mother's door in Waltham, and the three abolitionists on their way to the meeting - "
<p>"Now what's the use, Billy Stark?" cried the old lady. "I told you it was a fake from beginning to end. So it is. So is every page of it. If I'd written my recollections as they were, the book would have been a pamphlet of twenty odd pages. It would have said I married a learned professor because I thought if I got into Cambridge society I should see life, and life was what I wanted. It would have gone on to say I found it death and nothing else, and when my husband died I spent all the money I could get trying to see life and I never saw it then. Who'd have printed that? Pretty recollections, I should say!"
<p>Mr. Stark was still musing, his eyes interrogating her.
<p>"It's really incredible, Florrie," he said at last. "Poor dear! you needed the money."
<p>"That wasn't it."
<p>"Then what was?"
<p>"I don't know." But immediately her face folded up into its smiling creases and she said, "I wanted some fun."
<p>William Stark fell back in his chair and began to laugh, round upon wheezy round. When his glasses had fallen off and his cheeks were wet and his face flamed painfully, Madam Fulton spoke, without a gleam.
<p>"You're a nice man, Billy Stark."
<p>"You wanted your little joke!" he repeated, subsiding and trumpeting into his handkerchief. "Well, you've had it, Florrie; you've had it."
<p>"I don't know that I have," she returned. "I had to enjoy it alone, and that kind of palled on me. When the first notices came, I used to lie awake from three o'clock on, to laugh. I used to go to the window when Electra was in the room, and make up faces, to let off steam and keep her from knowing. Then the letters kept coming, and clubs and things kept hounding me, and Electra was always at me. There she is now, with my grog. See me take it and pour it into the syringa."
<p>Electra was crossing the veranda with her springing step, bearing a glass of beaten egg and milk on a little tray. Madam Fulton signed to her to place the tray on a table, evidently ready for such ministrations, and then presented her friend. Electra greeted him with a smile of bright acceptance. She knew his standing, and his air of worldly ease quite satisfied her.
<p>"May I bring you - ?" she began, with a pretty grace.
<p>"I should like a glass of water," said Billy, "if you will be so good."
<p>When she had gone, Madam Fulton spoke in impressive haste: -
<p>"How long can you stay, Billy? All day? All night?"
<p>"I've got to run back to New York for a bit, but I shall be in America all summer, one place or another. I'll stay to luncheon, if you'll let me."
<p>"We must avoid Electra! If she comes back and settles on us, I shall simply take you to walk. We can go over to Bessie Grant's. You remember her. She married the doctor."
<p>"I remember."
<p>Electra had returned with a glass and pitcher, and ice clinking pleasantly. She took occasion to explain to Madam Fulton, with some civil hesitation, -
<p>"I have a committee meeting, grandmother. I had planned to go in town."
<p>The old lady responded briskly.
<p>"Go, my dear, go. Mr. Stark will stay to luncheon. We'll look out for each other."
<p>When Electra had rustled away, after the pleasantest of farewell recognitions between her and the guest, Madam Fulton heaved a sigh.
<p>"Billy," said she, "that's a dreadful girl."
<p>"She's a very handsome girl. What's the matter with her?"
<p>"She's so equipped. First, she's well born. Her grandmother was a Grace and her mother was a Vanderdecken. See her teeth. See her hair, and her profile. Dreadful!"
<p>"They're very beautiful, in a correct way. She's as well made as a grand piano."
<p>"That's it, Billy. And she has done nothing but polish herself, and now you can see your face in her. Fancy, Billy, what these modern creatures do. They go to gymnasium. They can take a five-barred gate, I believe, in their knickerbockers and what they call sneakers. They understand all about foods and what's good for them and what's good for the aged, and if you're over seventy they buy condensed foods in cans and make you take it twice a day."
<p>"You haven't tasted your grog."
<p>"I shan't. Want it?"
<p>He accepted the glass, and sniffed at it critically.
<p>"That's good," he commented. "That's very good. There's a familiar creature in that." He tasted, and then drank with gusto.
<p>"Well," said the old lady disparagingly, "you wouldn't have said so if it had been one of the foods. I have them before I go to bed."
<p>He spoke persuasively: "Florrie, let's talk a little more about the book."
<p>"There's nothing more to say. I've told you the whole story, and I know you won't tell anybody else."
<p>"Don't you think you'd better make a clean breast of it to Gilbert and Wall?"
<p>"What for?"
<p>"Well, I don't know exactly: only it seems to me publishers and authors are in a more or less confidential relation. Being a publisher myself, I naturally feel rather strongly about it."
<p>"I don't see it in the least," said the old lady decisively. "All this talk about the paternal relation is mere poppycock. They print me a book. If it takes a start, they back it. They're as glad as I am. But as to telling them my glorious little joke, why, I can't and I won't."
<p>"But, dear woman, they're printing away with full confidence in having got a valuable book out of you."
<p>"So they have. It's selling, isn't it?"
<p>"Madly. Specialists want it for honest data. The general reader has got an idea from the reviews that there's personal gossip in it, more or less racy. So it goes."
<p>"Well, let it go," said the old lady recklessly. "I shan't stop it."
<p>"No, but I can't help thinking Gilbert and Wall ought to be in the secret."
<p>"Do you imagine they'd stop printing?"
<p>"I don't imagine anything. I believe, to speak temperately, they'd drop dead. I only say it's a fearful and wonderful situation, and they ought to know it. You see, dear woman, you've not only played a joke on the public; you've played a joke on them."
<p>"Well, for goodness' sake, why not? What's a publisher, anyway? Has he got to be treated like a Hindu god? Billy Stark, I wish you'd stayed in London where you belong."
<p>Again Billy felt himself wheezing, and gave up to it as before. She watched him unwinkingly, and by and by she chuckled a little and then joined him, in an ecstasy.
<p>"Florrie," said he, "you're simply a glorious portent, and you've no more moral sense than the cat."
<p>"No, Billy, no!" She was answering in a happy acquiescence. "I never had any. I've always wanted some fun, and I want it to this day." Her old face changed surprisingly under a shade of gravity. "And see where it's led me." It was natural to conclude that her verdict embraced wider evidence than that of the erring book. Billy, quite serious in his turn, looked at her in candid invitation. She answered him earnestly and humbly: "Billy, I always took the wrong road. I took it in the beginning and I never got out of it."
<p>"There's a frightful number of wrong turnings," Billy offered, in rather inadequate sympathy, "and a great deficiency of guideposts."
<p>"You see, Billy, the first thing I did was to give up Charlie Grant and marry Mark Fulton. I was only a country girl. Charlie was a country boy. I thought Mark must be a remarkable person because he was a professor in Cambridge. I thought Charlie was going to be a poor little country doctor, because he was studying medicine with another country doctor, and he couldn't go to college to save his skin. There were eight children, you know, younger than he. He had to work on the farm. Well, Billy, I made a mistake."
<p>Stark marveled at the crude simplicity of all this. He forgot, for the moment, that she was an old woman, and that for a long time she had been conning over the past like a secret record, full of blemishes, perhaps, but not now to be remedied.
<p>"You did like Charlie," he ventured. "I knew that."
<p>"I liked him very much. And I've never quite escaped from his line of life, if that's what they call it. Since Electra was alone and I came here to stay with her, I've been thrown with his widow. Bessie's an old woman, too, you know, like me. But she's a different kind."
<p>"She was a pretty girl. Rather sedate, I remember, for a girl."
<p>"Billy, she's a miracle. She lives alone, all but old Mary to do the work. She's stiffened from rheumatism so that she sits in her chair nearly all day, and stumps round a little, in agony, with two canes. But she's had her life."
<p>"How has she had it, Florrie? In having Grant?"
<p>"Because all her choices were good choices. She took him when he was poor, and she helped him work. They had one son. He married a singer, a woman - well, like me. Maybe it was in the blood to want a woman like me. Then this boy and the singer had two sons - one of them clever. Peter Grant, you know. I suppose he's a genius, if there are such. The other has - a deformity."
<p>"I know," he nodded. "You wrote me."
<p>"I didn't write you all. He wasn't born with it. He was a splendid boy, but when he had the accident the mother turned against him. She couldn't help it. I see how it was, Billy. The pride of life, that's what it is - the pride of life."
<p>"Is he dwarfed?"
<p>"Heavens! he was meant for a giant, rather. He has great strength. Somehow he impresses you. But it's the grandmother that built him up, body and brain. Now he's a man grown, and she's made him. Don't you see, Billy? she's struck home every time."
<p>"Is she religious?"
<p>"Yes, she is. She prays." Her voice fell, with the word. She looked at him searchingly, as if he might understand better than she did the potency of that communion.
<p>"She's a Churchwoman, I suppose."
<p>"No, no. She only believes things - and prays. She told me one day Osmond - he's the deformed one - he couldn't have lived if she hadn't prayed."
<p>"That he would be better?"
<p>"No, she was quite explicit about that. Only that they would be taught how to deal with it - his trouble. To do it, she said, as God wished they should. Billy, it's marvelous."
<p>"Well, dear child," said Billy, "you can pray, too."
<p>Her old face grew pinched in its denial.
<p>"No," she answered sadly, "no. It wouldn't rise above the ceiling. What I mean is, Billy, that all our lives we're opening gates into different roads. Bessie Grant opened the right gate. She's got into a level field and she's at home there. But I shouldn't be. I only go and climb up and look over the bars. And I go stumbling along, hit or miss, and I never get anywhere."
<p>He was perplexed. He frowned a little.
<p>"Where do you want to get, Florrie?" he asked at length.
<p>She smiled into his face engagingly.
<p>"I don't know, Billy. Only where things don't bore me; where they are worth while."
<p>"But they always get to bore us - " he paused and she took him up.
<p>"You mean I'm bored because I am an old woman. I should say so, too, but then I look at that other woman and I know it isn't so. No, Billy, I took the wrong road."
<p>Billy looked at her a long time searchingly.
<p>"Well," he said at last, "what can we do about it? I mean, besides writing fake memoirs and then going ag'in our best friends when they beg us to own up?"
<p>She put the question by, as if it could not possibly be considered, and yet as if it made another merry chapter to her jest. Billy had gathered his consolatory forces for another leap.
<p>"Florrie," said he, "come back to London with me."
<p>"My dear child!"
<p>"You marry me, Florrie. I asked you fifty odd years ago. I could give you a good sober sort of establishment, a salon of a sort. I know everybody in arts and letters. Come on, Florrie."
<p>Fire was in the old lady's eye. She rose and made him a pretty courtesy.
<p>"Billy," said she, "you're splendid. I won't hold you to it, but it will please me to my dying day to think I've had another offer. No, Billy, no. You wouldn't like it. But you're splendid."
<p>Billy, too, had risen. They took hands and stood like boy and girl looking into each other's eyes. There was a little suffusion, a tear perhaps, the memory of other times when coin did not have to be counted so carefully, when they could open the windows without inevitable dread of the night, its dark and chill. The old lady broke the moment.
<p>"Come over and see Bessie Grant. What do you say?"
<p>"Delighted. Get your hat."
<p>But she appeared with a gay parasol, one of Electra's, appropriated from the stand with the guilty consideration that the owner would hardly be back before three o'clock. The old lady liked warm colors. She loved the bright earth in all its phases, and of these a parasol was one. They went down the broad walk and out into the road shaded by summer green, that quivering roof-work of drooping branches and many leaves.
<p>"Billy," said she, "I'm glad you've come."
<p>"So am I, Florrie; so am I."
<p>It was not far to the old Grant house, rich in the amplitude of its size, and of the grounds, where all conceivable trees that make for profit and delight were colonized according to a wise judgment. The house was large, of a light yellow with white trimmings and green blinds, and the green of the shrubbery relieved it and endowed it with an austere dignity. There was a curving driveway to the door, and following it, they came to the wide veranda, where an old lady sat by herself, dozing and reflecting as Madam Fulton had done that morning. The two canes by her chair told the story of a sad inaction. She was of heroic stature and breadth. Her small, beautifully poised head had thick white hair rolled back and wound about in a soft coil. Her face, pink with a persistent bloom, soft with a contour never to break or grow old, was simply a mother's face. It had the mother look, - the sweet serious eyes, the low brow, for beauty not for thought, the tranquil mouth. She was dressed in a fine cambric simply made, with little white ruffles about her neck and above her motherly hands. Madam Fulton saw her debating as they came, frowning a little, wondering evidently about the stranger. She called to her.
<p>"Who is this, Bessie Grant?"
<p>The other woman laid a hand upon her canes, and then, as if this were an instinctive movement, yet not to be undertaken hurriedly, smiled and sat still, awaiting them. When they were at the steps, she spoke in an exceedingly pleasant voice. It deepened the effect of her great gentleness.
<p>"I'm sure I don't know. Come right up and tell me."
<p>They mounted the steps together, and Stark put out his hand. Mrs. Grant studied him for a moment. Light broke over her sweet old face.
<p>"It's Billy Stark," she said.
<p>"Of course it is," triumphed the other old lady. "Billy Stark come back from foreign parts as good as new. Now let's sit down and talk it over."
<p>They drew their chairs together, and, smiles and glances mingling, went back over the course of the years, first with a leap to the keen, bright time when they were in school together. The type of that page was clear-cut and vivid. There were years they skipped then, and finally they came to the present, and Billy said, -
<p>"You have two grandsons?"
<p>"Yes. One lives with me. The other is coming home to-morrow. He's the painter."
<p>"Engaged to Electra," added Madam Fulton. "Did you know that? They are to be married this summer. Then I suppose he'll go back to Paris and she'll go with him."
<p>Mrs. Grant was looking at her with a grave attention.
<p>"We hope not," she said, "Osmond and I. Osmond hopes Peter will settle here and do some work. He thinks it will be best for him."
<p>"There's no difficulty about his getting it," said Billy. "I saw his portrait of Mrs. Rhys. That was amazing."
<p>The grandmother nodded, in a quiet pleasure.
<p>"They said so," she returned.
<p>"It will do everything for him."
<p>"It has done everything. Osmond says he has only to sit down now and paint. But he thinks it will be best for him to do it here - at least for a time."
<p>"How in the world can Osmond tell before he sees him?" objected Madam Fulton. "You haven't set eyes on Peter for five years. He may be Parisian to the backbone. You wouldn't want to tie him by the leg over here."
<p>"So Osmond says. But he hopes he won't want to go back."
<p>"I can tell him one thing," said the other old lady; "he'd better make up his mind to some big centre, Paris or New York, or he won't get Electra. Electra knows what she wants, and it isn't seclusion. She is going to be the wife of a celebrated painter, and she'll insist on the perquisites. I know Electra."
<p>Mrs. Grant smiled in deprecation; but Stark had a habit of intuitive leaps, and he judged that she also knew Electra. His mind wandered a little, as his eyes ran over the nearer features of the place. It hardly suggested wealth: only comfort and beauty, the grace that comes of long devotion, the loving eye, the practiced hand. Somebody's heart had been put into it. This was the labor that was not hired. He had a strong curiosity to see Osmond, and yet he could not ask for him because Madam Fulton had once written him some queer tale of the man's sleeping in the woods, in a house of his own building, and living the wild life his body needed. One thing he learned now: Osmond's name was never out of his grandmother's mouth. She quoted his decisions as if they stood for ultimate wisdom. His ways were good and lovely to her.
<p>The forenoon hour went by, and finally Madam Fulton remembered.
<p>"Bless me!" she said. "It's luncheon time. Come, Billy."
<p>The road was brighter now under the mounting sun. Madam Fulton was a little tired, and they walked silently. Presently, at her own gate, she suggested, not grudgingly, but as if the charm of goodness was, unhappily, assured, -
<p>"I suppose she's lovely!"
<p>"Great! She's one of those creatures that have good mother-stuff in them. It doesn't matter much what they mother. It's there. It's a kind of force. It helps - I don't know exactly how."
<p>"Now can't you see what I mean? That woman has had big things. She had one of the great loves. She built it up, piece by piece, with Charlie. He kept a devotion for her that wasn't to be compared with the tempest he felt about me. I'm sure of that."
<p>Stark looked at her as they walked, his eyes perplexedly denying the evidence of his ears.
<p>"Do you know, Florrie," he said, "it's incredible to hear you talk so."
<p>"Why?"
<p>"You have a zest for life, a curiosity about it. Why, it's simply tremendous."
<p>"No, Billy, no. It's not tremendous. It's only that I am quite convinced I haven't got my money's worth. Late as it is, I want it yet. I'll have it - if it's only playing jokes on publishers!"
<p>They ate together in the shaded room, and Madam Fulton, looking out through the windows at the terrace, realized, with an almost humble gratitude, that the world itself and the simple joys of it were quite different tasted in comradeship. She forgot Electra and the irritated sense that her well-equipped granddaughter was wooing her to the ideals of a higher life.
<p>"Billy," she said again, "I'm uncommon glad you came."
<p>Billy's heart warmed with responsive satisfaction He had expected a more or less colorless meeting with his old love, a philosophic reference here and there to vanished youth, a twilight atmosphere of waning days; but here she was, living as hard as ever. And he had brightened her; he had given her pleasure. The complacency of it reacted upon him, and he sought about in his clever mind for another drop to fill the beaker. By the time they had finished their coffee, he knew.
<p>"Florrie," said he, "what if you should put on your hat and take the train with me?"
<p>"My stars, Billy! Run away?"
<p>"Come up to town. We'd scare up some kind of a theatre this evening, and in the morning you could see Gilbert and Wall."
<p>"And 'fess? Not by a great sight! But I'd like to go, Billy. Leave out Gilbert and Wall, make it you and me, and I'm your man."
<p>"Come along."
<p>"Worry Electra to death!" she proffered brightly. "I'll do it, Billy. Here's the key of my little flat, right here on the writing-desk. I never stayed there alone, but there's no reason why I shouldn't. You can come round in the morning, to see if I've had a fit, and if I haven't we'll go to breakfast. But we must take the three o'clock. She'll be back by four."
<p>She got her bonnet and her handbag, and when Electra did come back at four, her grandmother had flown, leaving a note behind.
<p>The next morning Electra, dressed in white and rather pale at the lips, walked about the garden with a pretense of trimming a shrub here and there and steadying a flower. But she was waiting for her lover. She had expected him before. The ten o'clock would bring him, and he would come straight to her without stopping to see his grandmother and Osmond. But time went by, and she was nervously alert to the fact that he might not have come. Even Electra, who talked of poise and strove for it almost in her sleep, felt a little shaken at the deferred prospect of seeing him. It was after those five years, and his letters, voluminous as they were, had not told all. Especially had they omitted to say of late whether he meant to return to France when he should be able to take her with him. To see a lover after such a lapse was an experience not unconnected with a possibility of surprise in herself as well as in him. She had hardly, even at the first, explicitly stated that she loved him. She had only recognized his privilege of loving her. But now she had put on a white dress, to meet him, and the garden was, in a sense, a protection to her. The diversity of its flowery paths seemed like a shade out of the glare of a defined relation. At last there was a step and he was coming. She forced herself to look at him and judge him as he came. He had scarcely changed, except, perhaps from his hurrying gait and forward bend, that he was more eager. There was the tall figure, the loose tie floating back, the low collar and straight black hair - the face with its aquiline curve and the wide sweet mouth, the eager dark eyes - he looked exactly like the man who had painted the great portrait of the year. Then he was close to her, and both her hands were in his. He lifted them quickly to his lips, one and then the other.
<p>"Electra!" he said. It was the same voice, the slight eager hesitancy in it like the beginning of a stammer.
<p>Electra, to her surprise, said an inconsequent thing. It betrayed how she was moved.
<p>"Grandmother is away. She has gone to town."
<p>"We will go into the summer-house," said the eager voice. "That is where I always think of you. You remember, don't you?"
<p>He had kept her hand, and, like two children, they went along the broad walk and into the summer-house, where there was a green flicker of light from the vines. There was one chair, a rustic one, and Peter drew it forward for her. When she had seated herself, he sat down on the bench of the arbor close by, and, lifting her hand, kissed it again.
<p>"Do you remember the knock-kneed poem I wrote you, Electra?" he asked her. "I called it 'My Imperial Lady.' I thought of it the minute I saw you standing there. My imperial lady!"
<p>The current was too fast for her. She could not manage large, impetuous things like flaming words that hurtled at her and seemed to ask a like exchange - something strong and steady in her to meet them in mid-air and keep them from too swift an impact. His praise had always been like the warriors' shields clanging over poor Tarpeia, - precious, but too crushing. They disconcerted her. If she could not manage to escape after the first blow, she guessed how they might bruise.
<p>"When did you come?" she asked.
<p>Peter did not answer. He was still looking at her with those wonderful eyes that always seemed to her too compelling for happy intercourse.
<p>"Electra," he said, and stopped. She had to answer him. There must be some heavy thing to break to her, which he felt unequal to the task of telling unless she helped him. "Electra," he said again, "I didn't come alone. Some one came with me. I wrote you about Tom."
<p>Electra drew her hand away, and sat up straight and chilled. There had been few moments of her grown-up life, it seemed to her, unspoiled by Tom, her recreant brother. In the tumultuous steeple chase of his existence he had brought her nothing but mortification. In his death, he was at least marring this first moment of her lover's advent.
<p>"You wrote me everything," she said. The tone should have discouraged him. "You were with him at the last. He knew you. I gather he didn't send any messages to us, or you would have given them."
<p>"He did, Electra."
<p>"He sent a message?"
<p>"I simply couldn't write it, because I knew I should be home so soon. It was about his wife. He begged you to be kind to her."
<p>"His wife! Tom was not married."
<p>"He was married, Electra, to a very beautiful girl. I have brought her home with me."
<p>Electra was upon her feet. Her face had lost its cold sweet pallor. The scarlet of hot blood was upon it, a swift response to what seemed outrage at his hands.
<p>"I have never - " she gasped. "It is not true."
<p>Peter, too, had risen. He was looking at her rather wistfully. His imperial lady had, in that instant, lost her untouched calm. She was breathing ire.
<p>"Ah, don't say that," he pleaded. "You never saw her."
<p>"I can't help it. I feel it. She is an adventuress."
<p>"Electra!"
<p>"What did he say to you? What did Tom say?"
<p>"He pointed to her as she stood by the window, her back to us - it was the day before he died - and said, 'Tell them to be good to her.'"
<p>"You see! You don't even know whether he meant it as a message to me or some of his associates. He didn't say she was his wife?"
<p>"No."
<p>He answered calmly and rather gravely, but the green world outside the arbor looked unsteady to him. Electra was one of the fixed ideas of his life; her nobility, her reserve, her strength had seemed to set her far above him. Now she sounded like the devil's advocate. She was gazing at him keenly.
<p>"Her story made a great impression on you," she threw out incidentally.
<p>The effort was apparent, but Peter accepted it.
<p>"Yes," he answered simply. "She makes a great impression on everybody. She will on you."
<p>"What evidence have you brought me? Did you see them married?"
<p>"No," said Peter, with the same unmoved courtesy.
<p>"You see! Have you even found any record of their marriage?"
<p>"No."
<p>"You have the girl's word. She has come over here with you. What for?"
<p>Peter lifted a hand to his forehead. He answered gently as a man sometimes does, of set purpose, to avoid falling into a passion.
<p>"It was the natural thing, Electra. She has no home, poor child! - nor money, except what Tom left in his purse. He'd been losing pretty heavily just before. I say, it seemed the natural thing to come to you. Half this place was his. His wife belongs here." The last argument sounded to him unpardonably crude, as to an imperial lady, but he ventured it. Then he looked at her. With his artist's premonition, he looked to see her brows drawn, her teeth perhaps set angrily upon a quivering lip. But Electra was again pale. Her face was marble to him, to everything.
<p>"I shall fight it," she said inexorably, "to the last penny."
<p>He gazed at her now as if she were a stranger. It was incredible that this was the woman whose hand he had kissed but the moment before. He ventured one more defense.
<p>"Electra, you have not seen her."
<p>"I shall not see her. Where is she - in New York?"
<p>"Here."
<p>"Here!"
<p>"At grandmother's. I left her there. I thought when we had had our little talk you would come over with me and see her, and invite her home."
<p>"Invite her here?"
<p>"I thought so."
<p>"Peter," said Electra, with a quiet certainty, "you must be out of your mind."
<p>There they stood in the arbor, their lovers' arbor, gazing at each other like strangers. Peter recovered first, not to an understanding of the situation, but to the need of breaking its tension.
<p>"I fancied," he said, "you would be eager to know her."
<p>"Is she a grisette?"
<p>His mind ached under the strain of taking her in. He felt dumbly her contrast to the facile, sympathetic natures he had been thrown with in his life abroad. When he had left her, Electra was, as she would have said, unformed; she had not crystallized into the clearness and the hardness of the integrity she worshiped. To him, when in thought he contrasted her with those other types who made for joy and not always for moral beauty, she was immeasurably exalted. In any given crisis where other women did well, he would not have questioned that Electra must have done better. Her austerity was a part of her virgin charm. But as he looked at her now, in her clear outlines, her incisive speech, the side of him that thrilled to beauty trembled with something like distaste or fear. She was like her own New England in its bleakness, without its summer warmth. He longed for atmosphere.
<p>But she had asked her question again: "Is she a grisette?"
<p>He found himself answering: -
<p>"She is the daughter of Markham MacLeod."
<p>"Not the author? Not the chief?"
<p>"Yes," said Peter, with some quiet pride in the assurance, "chief of the Brotherhood, the great Markham MacLeod."
<p>Electra pondered.
<p>"If that is true," she said, "I must call on her."
<p>"True? I tell you it is true. Electra, what are you saying?"
<p>But Electra was looking at him with those clear eyes where dwelt neither guile nor tolerance of the guile of others.
<p>"Did she tell you so," she inquired, "or do you know it for a fact?"
<p>He had himself well in hand now, because it had sprung into his wise artist brain that he must not break the beauty of their interview. It was fractured, but if they turned the hurt side away from the light, possibly no one would know, and the outer crystalline sheen of the thing would be deceptively the same.
<p>"I know Markham MacLeod," he said. "I have seen them together. She calls him father."
<p>A wave of interest swept over her face.
<p>"Do you mean you really know him, Peter?"
<p>"Assuredly."
<p>"As the leader of the Brotherhood?"
<p>"Yes, the founder."
<p>"He is proscribed in Russia and watched in France. Is that true?"
<p>"All true."
<p>"He gave up writing for this - to go about organizing and speaking? That's true, isn't it?"
<p>"Quite true."
<p>"How much do you know about the Brotherhood, Peter?"
<p>"I belong to it."
<p>He straightened as he spoke. An impulse of pride passed over him, and she read the betrayal in his kindling eyes and their widened pupils.
<p>"Is there work for you?" she asked, "for men who don't speak and proselytize?"
<p>"I do speak, Electra."
<p>"You do?"
<p>"I have spoken a little. I can't do it yet in the way he wants. What he wants is money."
<p>"We have sent him money," she agreed. "The Delta Club gave a series of plays last winter and voted him the proceeds. The first was for labor in America. The second for free Russia."
<p>"Yes, it pours in on him. It's his enormous magnetism."
<p>"It's his cause."
<p>She seemed to have reached something now that warmed her into life, and he took advantage of that kindling.
<p>"Rose is his daughter," he reminded her. "She is very beautiful, very sad. She is worthy of such a father."
<p>"Rose? Is that her actual name?"
<p>"Yes. They are Americans, though since her childhood she has lived in France."
<p>"What did she do before Tom - got acquainted with her? Live there in Paris with her father?"
<p>"She sang. She has a moving voice. She always hoped she was going to sing better, but there never was money enough to give her the right training. Then she began going about with her father. She spoke, too."
<p>"In public? For the Brotherhood?"
<p>"Yes. She has great magnetism. But she stopped doing that."
<p>"Why?"
<p>"I don't know. I have heard her father ask her to do it, but she refused. She is beautiful, Electra."
<p>Electra was looking at him thoughtfully.
<p>"Did she persuade you to join the Brotherhood?" she asked.
<p>"No," said Peter, unmoved, "the chief himself persuaded me. I went to a great meeting one Sunday night. I heard him. That was the end of me. I knew where I belonged."
<p>Electra, her mind hidden from him as completely as if a veil had fallen between them, was, he could see, considering him. As for her, he hardly dared dwell upon her as she ruthlessly seemed. She was again like the bright American air, too determinate, too sharp. She almost hurt the eyes. He wondered vaguely over several things he was unwilling to ask her, since he could not bear to bring their difference to a finished issue: why she cherished a boundless belief in the father and only reprobation for the daughter, when she had seen neither the one nor the other; why she had this vivid enthusiasm for the charity that embraces the world and none for a friendless child at her door. Their interview seemed to have dropped flat in inconceivable collapse; what was to have been the beginning of their dual life was only the encounter of a hand-to-hand discussion. He tried to summon back the vividness to his fagged emotions, and gave it up. Then he ventured to think of his imperial lady, and found a satirical note beating into his mind. He took refuge in the practical.
<p>"I have not seen Osmond yet."
<p>"Wasn't he there to meet you?"
<p>"No. Grannie said I should have to go down to the plantation, to find him. Does he keep up his old ways, Electra?"
<p>"Yes. Sleeping practically out of doors summer and winter, or in the shack, as he calls it, - that log hut he put up years ago. Haven't you known about him? Hasn't he written?"
<p>"Oh, he writes, but not about himself. Osmond wouldn't do that. Somehow grandmother never wrote any details about him either. I fancied he didn't want her to. So I never asked. She only said he was 'well.' You know Osmond always says that himself."
<p>"I believe he is well," said Electra absently. She was thinking of the alien presence at the other house. "He looks it - strong, tanned. Osmond is very impressive somehow. It's fortunate he wasn't a little man."
<p>Peter made one of the quick gestures he had learned since he had been away from her. They told the tale of give and take with a more mobile people. He could not ask her to ignore Osmond's deformity, yet he could not bear to hear her speak of it. Osmond was, he thought, a colossal figure, to be accepted, whatever his state, like the roughened rock that builds the wall. He rose, terminating, without his conscious will, an interview that was to have lasted, if she had gone to the other house with him and he had returned again with her, the day long.
<p>"I must see Osmond," he hesitated.
<p>Electra, too, had risen.
<p>"Yes," she said conformably, though the table, she knew, would be laid for them both in what had promised to be their lovers' seclusion.
<p>"I will come back. This afternoon, Electra?"
<p>That morning, the afternoon had been his and hers only. She had expected to listen to the recital of his triumphs in Paris, and to scan eagerly the map of his prospects which was to show her way also. And she too opened her lips and spoke without preconsidered intent.
<p>"This afternoon I shall be busy. I have to go in town."
<p>"You won't - " he hesitated again. "Electra, you won't call at the house on the way, and see her, at least?"
<p>"Your Rose?" She smiled at him brilliantly. "Not to-day, Peter."
<p>Then, bruised, bewildered, he went back over the path he had come, leaving his imperial lady to go in and order the luncheon table prepared for one.
<p>"Madam Fulton will not be home," she said to the maid, with a proud unconsciousness; and for the moment it sounded as if Madam Fulton had been the expected guest.
<p>When Peter went up the steps of his grandmother's house, he found Mrs. Grant still on the veranda, and Rose beside her. The girl looked at him eagerly, as if she besought him for whatever message he had, and he answered the glance with one warmed by implied sympathy. Until he saw her, he had not realized that anger made any part in the emotion roused in him by his imperial lady. Now he remembered how this gracious young creature seemed to him, so innocent, so sad. He felt a rising in his throat, as he thought of subjecting her to unfriendly judgment. Rose, in spite of the serious cast of her face and the repose of her figure, wore an ineffable air of youth. She had splendid shoulders and a yielding waist, and her fine hands lay like a separate beauty in the lap of her black dress. She had the profile of a coin touched with finer human graces, a fullness of the upper lip, a slight waving of the soft chestnut hair over the low forehead, and lashes too dark for harmony with the gray eyes. There were defects in her flawlessness. Her mouth was large, in spite of its pout, and on her nose were a few beguiling freckles. At that moment, in her wayward beauty, lighted by the kindled eye of expectation, she seemed to Peter to be made up of every creature's best. His grandmother smiled at him out of her warm placidity, and though Rose still drew his eyes to her, he was aware that she did not mean to question him.
<p>"Electra has to go in town," he volunteered. "She won't be back. Perhaps not to-night."
<p>"You must stay here with us, my dear," said Mrs. Grant. "Peter, have her trunks moved into the west chamber."
<p>Still the girl's eyes seemed to interrogate him, and Peter sat down in a chair and twined his long fingers in and out. He felt the drop in temperature ready to chill the voyager who, after the lonely splendor of the sea, returns to the earth as civil life has made it.
<p>"We must remember she hadn't heard of you," he assured Rose blunderingly, out of his depression.
<p>"No. He had not written." She made the statement rather as that of a fact they shared together, and he nodded. "I am afraid it is unwelcome to her, the idea of me."
<p>"She doesn't know you," he assured her, in the same bungling apology. He expected her to betray some wound to her pride, but she only looked humble and a little crushed.
<p>Grannie had apparently not heard, and she said now, with her lovely gentleness, -
<p>"Don't you want to go upstairs, my dear, and be by yourself a little while? You have been traveling so far. We have noon dinner, you know. That will seem funny to you. Mary is getting it, but Peter will show you a room."
<p>Peter found her bag in the wide hall, darkened from the sun, and went with her up the stairs. At the head she paused and beckoned him to the window-seat over the front door.
<p>"Set it down there," she said rapidly, touching the bag with a finger. "Tell me - how did she receive it?"
<p>"What?"
<p>"You know. The news of me."
<p>"She was surprised."
<p>"Naturally. But what else? She was shocked!"
<p>"It was a shock, of course. In its suddenness, you know. You'd expect that."
<p>She sank down in the window-seat and clasped her hands upon her knees, looking at them thoughtfully. Her brows were drawn together.
<p>"Yes," she said, "yes. It was a shock. I see that. Well!" She looked up at him in a challenging directness before which he winced, conscious of the little he had to meet it with. "When am I to see her?"
<p>"I am not sure when she is to be back."
<p>"Ah! She won't come to me. Very well. I shall go to her." She laid her hand upon the bag, and rose, as if the interview were ended. Peter carried the bag in at the open door of her room, and after he had set it down, looked vaguely about him, as if arrangements might be bettered in the still, sweet place. She was smiling at him with an irradiating warmth.
<p>"You're sorry, aren't you?" she said, from a comprehension that seemed a proffer of vague sympathy. "It makes you feel inhospitable. You needn't. You're a dear. Your grandmother is lovely - lovely."
<p>Her praise seemed to Peter such a precious fruitage that the only thing, in delicacy, was to turn away and take it with him to enjoy. But she was calling him.
<p>"Peter!"
<p>He found her flushed and eagerly expectant, it seemed to him, as if his news had been uplifting to her. She looked at him, at the room, and rapidly from the window where the treetops trembled, all in one comprehensive sweep.
<p>"Peter," she said, with conviction, "it's simply lovely here."
<p>"It's a nice old place," responded Peter. He loved it from long use, but he was aware of its comfortable plainness.
<p>"I never saw anything so dear. Those square worn tiles down by the front door, the fireplace, the curtains, - look, Peter, it's dotted muslin." She touched a moving fold, and Peter laughed outright.
<p>"I like it," he said, "but there's nothing particular about it. If you want style, why, you'll have to look back at what you've left. When it comes to that, what's the matter with a château?"
<p>"Yes, yes." She put the château aside with one of her light movements of the hands. "But here I feel as if I'd come home to something. You see it's so safe here, Peter. It's so darling, too, so intimate. I can't tell what I mean. If Electra would only like me - O Peter, I could be almost happy, as happy as the day is long!" As she said the old phrase, it seemed to her to fit into the scene. She looked not merely as if happiness awaited her, but as if she could almost put her eager finger on it. And there was Electra, not so many rods away, drawbridge up and portcullis down, inquiring, "Is she a grisette?" Afterwards it seemed to Peter as if his sympathy for the distressed lady went to his head a little, for he lifted her hand and kissed it. But he did not speak, save to himself, going down the stairs: -
<p>"It's a damned shame!"
<p>When he went out on the veranda, grannie made a smiling comment: -
<p>"What a pretty child! Tom Fulton did well. He was a bad boy, wasn't he, Peter?"
<p>"Yes, grannie," said Peter, from the veranda rail where he sat picking rose leaves, "Tom was about the limit."
<p>"Well! well! poor girl. Maybe it's as well he went while she knew only the best of him."
<p>Peter was not sure she did know only the best, but he inquired, -
<p>"Shall I have time to run down and see Osmond before dinner?"
<p>"You'd better. He was here waiting when the carriage came. When he saw her, he slipped away."
<p>"Rose?"
<p>"Rose? Is that her name? Now isn't that pretty! Maybe you'll find him before you get to the plantation. I shouldn't wonder if he'd think it over and come back."
<p>Peter did meet him in the lane lined with locusts on each side, walking doggedly back to the house. Some things the younger brother had forgotten about him, the beauty of the dark face that looked as if it had been cut out of rock, the extraordinary signs of strength, in spite of that which might have appealed to pity. Osmond had grown rugged with every year. His long arms, ending in the brown, supple hands, looked as if they were compact of sinewy potencies. And on his shoulders, heavier than Christian's burden, was that pack he must carry to the end of life. He saw his brother coming, and stopped, and Peter, as if to save him the sense of being looked at from afar, even by his own kin, ran to meet him. They did not take hands, but the older brother gave him a slap on the shoulder.
<p>"Well, boy!" said he.
<p>There were tears in Peter's eyes.
<p>"Look-a-here," he cried, "I'm sniveling. Coming up to the house?"
<p>"No. I've been there once this morning. You come back with me."
<p>They turned about, and walked on through the lane. It led to the plantation; this was the nursery, here were the forcing beds, and all the beneficent growing things that had saved Osmond's life while he tended them, and also earned his bread for him, and Peter's bread and paints.
<p>"Well, boy," said Osmond, "you've brought a girl with you. That was why I cut. Who is she?"
<p>"Tom Fulton's wife - his widow."
<p>Osmond knew Electra very well. Some phases of her were apparent to him in his secluded life that her lover, under the charm of an epistolary devotion, had never seen.
<p>"Does Electra know it?" he asked.
<p>"I told her." Peter's tone added further, "Shut up, now!" and Osmond tacitly agreed.
<p>"Coming down to dinner?" he asked safely.
<p>"No, I must be back. I feel responsible for her - Rose. I brought her over. In fact, I rather urged her coming. Grannie has asked her to stay with us until Electra is - at home."
<p>"Is her name Rose?"
<p>"Yes - one of those creamy yellow ones. You must see her. She's a dear. She's a beauty, too."
<p>"Oh, I've seen her, - one ear and a section of cheek and some yellow hair. Then I ran."
<p>"For heaven's sake, man! what for?"
<p>"She's one of those invincible Parisians. I've read about them."
<p>Peter burst out laughing. Osmond's tone betrayed a terrified admiration.
<p>"Do you eat down here with the men?" Peter was asking.
<p>"Sometimes. I go up and eat with grannie once a day while she's alone. I shan't now."
<p>"Why not?"
<p>"You'll be here to keep her company, you and your Parisian. I've got to go on being a wild man, Pete. I shan't save my soul alive if I don't do that."
<p>Peter put out a hand and laid it, for an instant, on his brother's arm.
<p>"I don't know anything about your soul, old man," he said, with a moving roughness. "But if you like this kind of a life, you're going to have it, that's all. Who cooks the dinner?"
<p>"Pierre. He came just after you went to France. There's a pot-au-feu to-day. I smelled it when I went by the kitchen. It's a good life, Pete, - if you don't want to play the game." His eyes grew wistful, something like the eyes of the dog that longs for man.
<p>"If you don't play the game, I don't know who does."
<p>"Well!" Osmond smiled a little, whimsically. "Maybe I do; but I play with counters."
<p>Peter was not especially ready, save with a brush in his hand. He wanted to say something to the effect that Osmond was playing the biggest of all games, with the visible universe against him; but he hardly knew how to put it. It seemed, though, as if he might some time paint it into a picture. But Osmond was recognizing the danger of soft implication, and bluffly turned the talk.
<p>"Well, Pete, you've done it, haven't you?"
<p>There was no possibility of affecting to misunderstand. Peter knew what he had gone to Paris for, five years ago, and why Osmond had been sending him the steady proceeds of the garden farm. He was to prove himself, take his talent in his hand and mould it and turn it about with a constant will, and shape a cup to hold the drink that makes the gods jealous and men delirious with adulation. Peter was to live at his ease in Paris, sparing nothing that would keep him well and strong of heart, so that he could paint the best portraits in the world. Peter knew he had begun to paint the best portraits in the world, because he had done many good ones and one actual marvel, and suddenly, as it sometimes is in art after we have been patient and discouraged, the whole task seemed to him a light and easy one. In his extraordinary youth he had the freshness of his brain, his quick eye and obedient hand, and he felt, lightly and gayly, that he was rich, - but rich in a world where there was plenty more of whatever he might lose.
<p>"I guess so," he said, returning to the speech of his youth. "And I can do it twice, old man. I can do it a hundred times."
<p>Osmond stopped and laid a hand on a boulder at the termination of their way, where the lane opened into plowed fields. He looked off through the distance as if he saw the courts of the world and all the roads that run to fame. His eyes were burning. The hand trembled upon the rock.
<p>"By George!" he said, "it's amazing."
<p>"What is, Osmond?"
<p>"It's amazing that the world can hold so much for one man. You wouldn't think there would be water enough in all the rivers for one man to drink so deep. What does Electra say?"
<p>"About the painting? Nothing yet."
<p>"Didn't you speak of it? Why, you're covered with laurel, boy, like Jack-in-the-Green. She couldn't help seeing it."
<p>Peter, brought back to that luckless interview with the imperial lady, felt shamefaced in his knowledge of it.
<p>"We didn't get to that," he said. "We were talking about Rose. Who do you think she is, Osmond?"
<p>"Tom's widow. So you said."
<p>"Yes, but what more? She's the daughter of Markham MacLeod."
<p>He was watching Osmond narrowly, to weigh the effect of the name. But Osmond's face kept its impressive interest.
<p>"You know who he is," Peter suggested.
<p>"Yes, oh, yes! But that doesn't mean anything to me. Nothing does until I see the man. He works with too big a brush. He is an agitator. He may be Christ or Anti-Christ, but he's an agitator. That's all I know. I can't give a snap judgment of a man that gets whole governments into a huff and knows how to lead a rabble a million strong. So he's her father?"
<p>Peter, unreasonably irritated, pitched upon one word for a cause of war.
<p>"Rabble? What do you mean by that? Labor?"
<p>Osmond smiled broadly and showed his white teeth.
<p>"I'm labor myself," he said. "You know that, boy."
<p>"Then what do you want to talk so for? Rabble!"
<p>"I only meant it in relation to numbers," said Osmond, again irritatingly, in his indifference to all interests outside his dear boy's home-coming. "I'll make it a rabble of kings, if you say so. Folks, Peter, that's what I mean, folks. He deals with them in the mass. That makes me nervous. I can't like it."
<p>"He believes in the equality of man," Peter announced, as he was conscious, rather swellingly. "The downfall of kings, the freedom of the individual."
<p>"There's the pot-au-feu smoking inside that shack," said Osmond, indicating a shanty across the field. "Come and have dinner with labor."
<p>But Peter turned. He shook his head.
<p>"I can't, Osmond," he said. "I've brought this girl into the house, and I've got to see her through. Won't you come up to-night?"
<p>"Not till your Parisian has gone over to Electra's. You come down here. Come down about dusk and we'll have another go."
<p>As Peter hurried back, conscious of being a little late, he could have beaten his head against the locust trees for the stupidity of his home-coming. He had the shattered moment with Electra to remember, and now he had turned the other great meeting of the day into a fractious colloquy. Unformed yet vivid in his mind, for the last year, had been strong, determining anticipations of what would happen when he at last came home. He had known certainly what would happen when he saw Electra. She would still be the loveliest and best, and his would be the privilege of telling her so. And to Osmond, who had dug in the ground that Peter might work under the eye of men, he would return as one who has an account to give, and say, in effect, "You did it." But, laughably, neither of these things had happened. He forgot that he had in him the beginnings of a great painter in remembering that he had shown the obtuseness of an ass.
<p>He did not see Electra that night. After the noon dinner he left Rose and grannie intimately together, - the girl, with a gentle deprecation, as if she brought gifts not in themselves worth much, talking about Paris, the air young Peter had been breathing, - and betook himself again to Electra's house. It was all open to the day, but no one answered his knock. He went in and wandered from parlor to library, the dignified rooms that had once seemed to him so typical of her estate as compared to his own: for in those days he had been only a young man of genius with scarcely enough money to live and study on, save as his brother earned it for him. He sauntered in and out for an hour - it seemed as if even the two servants had gone - and then played snatches at the piano, to waken drowsy ears. But the house kept its quiet, and in the late afternoon he wandered home again. That evening he returned, and then there was some one to answer his knock. The maid told him Miss Electra had gone out; but though he waited in a fevered and almost an angry impatience, she did not return. Knowing her austere and literal truth, he could not believe that the denial was the conventional expedient, and in a wave of regret over the day, he longed for her inexpressibly. It seemed to him that no distance would be too great to bring him to her. He felt in events, and in himself also, the rushing of some force to separate them, and swung back, after his blame of her, into the necessity of a more passionate partisanship. When he went home, still without seeing her, he found his grandmother's house deserted. But the minute his foot sounded, there was a soft rush down the stairs. Rose stood beside him in the hall.
<p>"Did you see her?" she asked breathlessly.
<p>He strove to make his laugh an evidence of the reasonableness of what he had to answer.
<p>"No. She was obliged to be away."
<p>"Isn't she at home now?" asked the girl insistently. "She is there, and you refuse to hurt me. She won't see me!"
<p>"She is not there," said Peter, in relief at some small truth to tell. "I haven't seen her since morning."
<p>The girl stood there in the faint radiance of the hall lamp, her eyes downcast, thinking. She had dressed for dinner, though there was only high tea in the old-fashioned house, and delighted grannie beyond words. The old lady said it was as good as a play to her, who never went out, to see a lovely dress trailing about the rooms. Peter, looking at the girl, felt his heart admonish him that here was beauty demanding large return of kindly treatment from the world. Not only must justice be done her, but it must be done lavishly. This was for all their sakes. Electra could not be allowed to lose anything so precious, nor could he lose it either, his small share of tribute. She was speaking, still with that air of pondering: -
<p>"I must do it myself. I mustn't let you risk anything." Then she turned her full glance on him, and frankly smiled. "Good-night," she said, giving him her hand. "Don't speak of me to her. Don't think of me. I must do it all myself."
<p>Next morning it was a different Rose he saw, quite cosy and cheerful at the breakfast-table, with no sign of tragedy on her brow. The day was fair, and the mood of the world seemed to him, for no reason, to have lightened. It was not credible that Electra, of all gracious beings, should sulk outside the general harmony. After breakfast, when Rose had, with a sweet air of service, given grannie her arm to the veranda chair, she returned to Peter, waiting, perhaps for a word with her, in the hall. His hat swung from his hand, and seeing that, she spoke in a low, quick tone.
<p>"You are going over there. Don't do it."
<p>"I must. I want to see her."
<p>"I know. But not yet. Let me see her first. If you talk about me, it will make trouble between you, - not real trouble, perhaps, but something unfortunate, something wrong. I am going myself, now." She pointed out her hat and gloves where she had them ready, and without waiting for him to speak, began pinning on the hat. While she drew on the gloves she looked at him again with her charming smile. "Don't you see," she said, "we can get along better alone - two women? Which house is it?"
<p>He followed her out and down the steps.
<p>"I'll go part of the way with you."
<p>She waved a gay farewell to grannie, busy already at her knitting, and they went down the path. But at the gate she paused.
<p>"Now," she said, "which way? Which house?"
<p>"The next one."
<p>"I see. Among the trees. Now don't come. Whatever happens, don't come. If I am not here to dinner, - if I am never here. You simply must not appear in this. Good-by." She gave her parasol a little reassuring fling, as if it were a weapon that proved her amply armed, and took her swift way along the shaded road.
<p>Peter stood for a moment watching her. She went straight on, and the resolution of her gait bore sufficient witness to her purpose. He turned about then and went rather disconsolately the other way, which would bring him out at the path to Osmond's plantation.
<p>Rose, going up the garden path, came upon Electra herself, again dressed in white and among the flower-beds. Whether she hoped her lover would come, and was awaiting him, her face did not tell; but she met Rose with the same calm expectancy. There was ample time for her to walk away, to avoid the interview; but Electra was not the woman to do that. False things, paltering things, were as abhorrent to her in her own conduct as in that of another. So she stood there, her hands at her sides in what she would have called perfect poise, as Rose, very graceful yet flushed and apparently conscious of her task, came on. A pace or two away, she stopped and regarded the other woman with a charming and deprecatory grace.
<p>"Do guess who I am!" she said, in a delightful appeal. "Peter Grant told you."
<p>"Won't you come in?" returned Electra, with composure. "Mr. Grant did speak of you."
<p>Rose felt unreasonably chilled. However little she expected, this was less, in the just civility that was yet a repudiation. They went into the library, where the sun was bright on rows of books, and Electra indicated a seat.
<p>"Mr. Grant told me a very interesting thing about you," she volunteered, with the same air of establishing a desirable atmosphere.
<p>"Yes," said Rose rather eagerly. She leaned forward a little, her hands clasped on her parasol top. "Yes. I forbade him to say any more. I wanted to tell you myself."
<p>Electra's brows quivered perceptibly at the hint of familiar consultation with Peter, but she answered with a responsive grace, -
<p>"He told me the interesting fact. It is very interesting indeed. We have all followed your father's career with such attention. There is nothing like it."
<p>"My father!" There was unconsidered wonder in her gaze.
<p>Electra smiled agreeingly.
<p>"He means just as much to us over here as he does to you in France - or England. Hasn't he been there speaking within the month?"
<p>"He is in England now," said Rose still wonderingly, still seeking to finish that phase and escape to her own requirements.
<p>"Mr. Grant said you speak, at times."
<p>"I am sorry he said that," Rose declared, recovering herself to an unshaded candor. "I shall never do it again."
<p>Electra was smiling very winningly.
<p>"Not over here?" she suggested. "Not before one or two clubs, all women, you know, all thoughtful, all earnest?"
<p>Rose answered coldly, -
<p>"I am not in sympathy with the ideas my father talks about."
<p>"Not with the Brotherhood!"
<p>"Not as my father talks about it." She grew restive. Under Electra's impenetrable courtesy she was committing herself to declarations that had been, heretofore, sealed in her secret thought. "I want to talk to you," she said desperately, with the winning pathos of a child denied, "not about my father, - about other things."
<p>"This is always the way," said Electra pleasantly, with her immutable determination behind the words. "He is your father, and your familiarity makes you indifferent to him. There are a million things I should like to know about Markham MacLeod, - what he eats and wears, almost. Couldn't you tell me what induced him - what sudden, vital thing, I mean - to stop his essay-writing and found the Brotherhood?"
<p>Rose answered coldly, and as if from irresistible impulse, -
<p>"My father's books never paid."
<p>Electra gazed at her, with wide-eyed reproach.
<p>"You don't give that as a reason!"
<p>Rose had recovered herself and remembered again the things she meant to leave untouched.
<p>"No," she said, "I don't give it as a reason. I only give it."
<p>Electra was looking at her, rebuffed and puzzled; then a ray shot through her fog.
<p>"Ah," she said, "wouldn't it be one of the inconceivable things if we who have followed his work and studied him at a distance knew him better than you who have had the privilege of knowing him at first hand?"
<p>In spite of herself, Rose answered dryly, -
<p>"It would be strange."
<p>But Electra had not heard. There was the sound of wheels on the drive, and she looked out, to see Madam Fulton alighting.
<p>"Excuse me, one moment," she said. "My grandmother has come home from town."
<p>When Rose was alone in the room, she put her hand to her throat to soothe its aching. There were tears in her eyes. She seemed to have attempted an impossible task. But presently Electra was entering again, half supporting by the arm a fragile-looking old lady who walked inflexibly, as if she resented that aid. Madam Fulton was always scrupulous in the appointments of her person; but this morning, with the slightly fagged look about her eyes and her careful bonnet a trifle awry, she disclosed the fact that she had dressed in haste for a train. But she seemed very much alive, with the alert responsiveness of those to whom interesting things have happened.
<p>"I want my grandmother to be as surprised as I am," Electra was saying, with her air of social ease. "Grandmother, who do you think this is? The daughter of Markham MacLeod!" She announced it as if it were great news from a quarter unexplored and wonderful. Rose was on her feet, her pathetic eyes fixed upon the old lady's face. Madam Fulton was regarding her with a frank interest it consoled her to see. It was not, at least, so disproportioned.
<p>"Dear me!" said the old lady. "Well, your father is a remarkable man. Electra here has all his theories by heart."
<p>"I wish I had," breathed Electra with a fervency calculated perhaps to distract the talk from other issues.
<p>"How long have you been in America?" asked the old lady civilly, though not sitting down. She had to realize that she was tired, that it would be the part of prudence to escape to her own room.
<p>"I have just come," said Rose, in a low, eloquent voice, its tones vibrating with her sense of the unfriendliness that had awaited her.
<p>"And where are you staying? How did you drift down here?"
<p>"At Mrs. Grant's - for the present." What might have been indignation warmed the words.
<p>"Grandmother, you must be tired," said Electra affectionately. "Let me go to your room with you, and see you settled."
<p>"Nonsense!" said the old lady briskly. "Nonsense! I'm going, but I don't need any help. Good-by, Miss MacLeod. I shall want to see you again when I have a head on my shoulders."
<p>She had gone, and still Electra made no sign of bidding her guest sit down again. Instead, she turned to Rose with an engaging courtesy.
<p>"You will excuse me, won't you? I ought to go to grandmother. She is far from strong."
<p>Rose answered quickly, -
<p>"Forgive me! I will go. But" - she had reached the door, and paused there entreatingly - "when may I see you again?"
<p>"Grandmother's coming will keep me rather busy," said Electra, in her brilliant manner. "But I shall take great pleasure in returning your visit. Good-by."
<p>Rose, walking fast, was out upon the road again, blind to everything save anger, against herself, against the world. She had come to America upon an impulse, a daring one, sure that here were friendliness and safety such as she had never known. She had found a hostile camp, and every fibre in her thrilled in savage misery. Half way along the distance home Peter came eagerly forward to her from the roadside where he had been kicking his heels and fuming. The visit to Osmond had not been made. At the plantation gate he had turned back, unable to curb his desire to know what had gone on between these two. At once he read the signs of her distress, the angry red in her cheeks, the dilated eye. Even her nostrils seemed to breathe defiance or hurt pride. She spoke with unconsidered bitterness.
<p>"I ought never to have come."
<p>"What was it? Tell me."
<p>"It was nothing. I was received as an ordinary caller. That was all."
<p>"Who received you?"
<p>"She. Electra."
<p>"What then?"
<p>"I was presented to her grandmother as my father's daughter, not as her brother's - wife." She was breathless upon the word. All the color went out of her face. She looked faint and wan.
<p>"But it couldn't be," he was repeating. "Didn't you speak of Tom at all?"
<p>"No."
<p>"Didn't she?"
<p>"No."
<p>He essayed a bald and unreasonable comfort.
<p>"There, you see! You didn't mention him, and Electra hardly brings herself to do it to any one. He never ceased being a trial to her. You must let me say that."
<p>"Ah, that wasn't it! Every time I might have spoken, a hand, a clever, skillful hand and cold as ice pushed me away. I can never speak of it. She won't let me."
<p>He was with her, every impulse of his eager heart; but a tardy conscience pulled him up, bidding him remember that other loyalty.
<p>"Give her time," he pleaded. "It's a shock to her. Perhaps it ought not to be; but it is. Everything about Tom has always been a shock."
<p>She, as well as he, remembered now that they spoke of Electra, whose high-bred virtues he had extolled to her in those still evenings on their voyage, when her courage failed her and he had opened to her the book of Electra's truth and justice.
<p>"Do you think," she said wistfully, "I might stay at your grandmother's a few days more?"
<p>"You are to stay forever. Grannie dotes upon you."
<p>"No! no! But I shall have to think. I shall have to make my plans."
<p>Again Peter felt yesterday's brand of anger against his imperial lady, or, he told himself immediately, the unfortunate circumstances of this misunderstanding. "You run on," he said. "Grannie's where you left her. If you don't feel like talking you can skip in at that little gate and the side door up to your room. I'm going back to see Electra."
<p>"You mustn't talk about me!"
<p>"No!" He smiled at her in a specious reassurance, and went striding on over the path by which she had come.
<p>Electra, in the fulfillment of her intention, had gone scrupulously to her grandmother's door, to ask if she needed anything, and then, when she had been denied, returned to the library, where she stood when Peter appeared on the threshold, as if she had been expecting him. He did not allow his good impulse to cool, but hurried forward to her with an abounding interest and a certainty of finding it fulfilled. As at first, when he had come to her in the garden the day before, he uttered her name eloquently, and broke out upon the heels of it, -
<p>"I didn't see you all yesterday, after that first minute."
<p>Electra looked at him seriously, and his heart sank. Peter had been thinking straight thoughts and swearing by crude values in these five years when he had lived with men and women who said what they meant, things often foolish and outrageous, but usually honest, and his mind had got a trick of asserting itself. None of the judgments it had been called upon to make seemed to matter vitally; but this one disconcertingly did, and to his horror he found himself wondering if Electra could possibly mean to be so hateful. Electra meant nothing of the kind. She had a pure desire toward the truth, and she assumed that Peter's desire tallied with her own. She felt very strongly on the point in question, and she saw no reason why he should not offer the greatest hospitality toward her convictions.
<p>"Peter," she said at once, "you must not talk to me about that woman."
<p>"So she said," Peter was on the point of irresistibly retorting, but he contented himself with the weak make-shift that at least gains time, -
<p>"What woman?"
<p>"Markham MacLeod's daughter."
<p>"Tom's wife? Tom's widow?"
<p>Electra looked at him in definite reproof.
<p>"You must not do that, Peter," she warned him. "You must not speak of her in that way."
<p>"For God's sake, why not, Electra?"
<p>"That is not her title. You must not give it to her."
<p>He stared at her for a number of seconds, while she met his gaze inflexibly. Then his face broke up, as if a hand had struck it. Light and color came into it, and his mouth trembled.
<p>"Electra," he said, "what do you want me to understand?"
<p>"You do understand it, Peter," she said quietly. "I can hardly think you will force me to state it explicitly."
<p>"You can't mean it! no, you can't. You mustn't imply things, Electra. You imply she was not married to him."
<p>Still Electra was looking at him with that high demeanor which, he felt with exasperation, seemed to make great demands upon him of a sort that implied assumptions he must despise.
<p>"This is very difficult for me," she was saying, and Peter at once possessed himself of one passive hand.
<p>"Of course it is difficult," he cried warmly. "I told her so. I told her everything connected with Tom always was difficult. She knows that as well as we do."
<p>"Have you talked him over with her?" The tone was neutral, yet it chilled him.
<p>"Good Lord, yes! We've done nothing but talk him over from an outside point of view. When she was deciding whether to come here, whether to write you or just present herself as she has - of course Tom's name came into it. She was Tom's wife, wasn't she? Tom's widow?"
<p>"No! no!" said Electra, in a low and vehement denial. "She was not." Peter blazed so that he seemed to tower like a long thin guidepost showing the way to anger. "I said the same thing yesterday."
<p>"That was before you saw her. It means more now, infinitely more."
<p>"I hope it does."
<p>"Think what you're saying, Electra," he said violently, so that she lifted her hand slightly, as if to reprove him. "You refuse to receive her - "
<p>"I have received her, - as her father's daughter. I may even do so again."
<p>"But not as your sister?"
<p>"That would be impossible. You must see it is impossible, feeling as I do."
<p>"But how, how? You imply things that dizzy me, and then, when it comes to the pinch, I can't get a sane word out of you." That seemed to him, as to her, an astonishing form of address to an imperial lady, and he added at once, "Forgive me!" But he continued irrepressibly, "Electra, you can't mean you doubt her integrity."
<p>She had her counter question: -
<p>"Did you see them married?"
<p>"No, no, heavens, no! Why, I didn't come on Tom in Paris until his illness. Tom never had any use for me. You know that. Meantime he'd been there a couple of years, into the mire and out again, and he'd had time to be married to Rose, and she'd had time to leave him."
<p>"Ah, she left him! Why?"
<p>"Why did you leave him, Electra, before he went over there? Why did you give up living in town, and simply retreat down here? You couldn't stand it. Nobody could. Tom was a bad egg, Electra. I don't need to tell you that."
<p>"It is certainly painful for me to hear it."
<p>"But why, why, Electra? I can't stultify myself to prove this poor girl an adventuress. I can't canonize Tom Fulton, not even if you ask me."
<p>"There are things we need not recur to. My brother is dead," said Electra, with dignity.
<p>"Yes. That's precisely why I am asking you to provide for his widow."
<p>"Suppose, then, this were true. Suppose she is what you say, - don't you feel she forfeited anything by leaving him?"
<p>"Ah, but she went back, poor girl! She went back to him when he was pretty well spent with sickness and sheer fright. Tom didn't die like a hero, Electra. Get that out of your mind."
<p>She put up both hands in an unconsidered protest.
<p>"Oh, what is the use!" she cried; and his heart smote him.
<p>"None at all," he answered. "But I mean to show you that this girl didn't walk back to any dead easy job when she undertook Tom."
<p>"Why did she do it?"
<p>"Why? From humanity, justice, honor, I suppose, the things that influence women when they stick to their bad bargains."
<p>"Where had she been meantime?"
<p>"With her father, in lodgings. That was where I met her."
<p>"Was she known by my brother's name?"
<p>"No," he hesitated, "not then. I knew her as Miss MacLeod."
<p>"Ah!"
<p>"I can see why," Peter declared, with an eager emphasis. "I never thought of it before, but can't you see? I should think a woman could, at least. The whole situation was probably so distasteful to her that she threw off even his name."
<p>"And assumed it after his death!"
<p>"No! no! She was called Madame Fulton at his apartment. I distinctly remember that."
<p>They had been immovably facing each other, but now Electra turned away and walked back to the library table, where she stood resting one hand and waiting, pale and tired, yet unchanged. This seemed to her one of the times that try men's souls, but wherein a New England conscience must abide by its traditions.
<p>"How long does she propose remaining?" she asked, out of her desire to put some limit to the distasteful situation, though she had forbidden herself to enter it with even that human interest.
<p>"Why, as long as we ask her to stay, - you, or, if she is not to expect anything from you, I. She has nothing of her own, poor girl."
<p>"Has her father repudiated her? That ought to tell something."
<p>Peter was silent for a moment. Then he said in an engaging honesty, bound as it was to hurt his own cause, -
<p>"I don't know. I don't understand their relation altogether. Rose gives no opinions, but I fancy she is not in sympathy with him."
<p>"Yes, I fancied so."
<p>"But we mustn't fancy so. We mustn't get up an atmosphere and look through it till we see distorted facts."
<p>"Those are what I want, Peter, facts. If Miss MacLeod - "
<p>"Do you mean you won't even give her your brother's name?"
<p>"Even, Peter! What could be more decisive?"
<p>"Do you expect me to introduce her as Miss MacLeod? Do you expect me to call her so?"
<p>"I fancied you called her Rose."
<p>"I did. I do. I began it in those unspeakable days when Tom went out of his head with fright and fever and we held him down in bed. Electra!"
<p>She was listening.
<p>"Was that grandmother calling?" she asked, though grandmother never yet had summoned her for companionship or service. But Electra felt her high decorum failing her. She was tired with the impact of emotion, and it was a part of her creed never to confess to weakness. She had snatched at the slight subterfuge as if it were a sustaining draught. "I am afraid I must go."
<p>"Electra!" He placed himself before her with outstretched hands. Very simple emotions were talking in him. They told him that this was the second day of his return, that he was her lover, and he had not kissed her. And they told him also, to his sheer fright and bewilderment, that he did not want to kiss her. All he could ineffectually do was to reiterate, "We can't go on like this. Nothing in the world is worth it." Yet while he said it, he knew there was one thing at least infinitely worth while: to right the wrongs of a beautiful and misjudged lady. Only it was necessary, apparently, for the present, to keep the lady out of the question.
<p>Electra was listening.
<p>"It is grandmother," she said recklessly. "I must go."
<p>There was a rustle up the staircase, and he was alone in the library, to take himself home as he might.
<p>After a week Electra had made no sign toward acceptance of the unbidden guest. She received Peter sweetly and kindly whenever he went to see her, but he felt they were very far apart. Something had been destroyed; the bubble of pleasure was broken and, as it seemed, for good and all. He strove to find his way back into their lost dream and take her with him; but there was no visible path. Rose spared him questions. She stayed gratefully on, and grannie was delighted with her. Rose had such a way of fitting into circumstance that it seemed an entirely natural thing to have her there, and Peter forgot to wonder even at the pleasure of it. Twice she came in from a walk pale and inexplicably excited, and he knew she had been besieging the scornful lady in the other house. But she kept her counsel. She had never seen Osmond since her coming, though she knew he and Peter had long talks together at the plantation.
<p>One night, a cold, unseasonable one, Osmond was alone in the shack, his room unlighted save by the flaring wood. The cabin had a couch, two chairs, and a big table, this covered with books. There were books on the wall, and the loft above, where he slept when he was not in his neighboring tent, made a balcony, taking half the room. He was in his long chair stretched among the shadows, his face lighted intermittently from the fire. He was thinking deeply, his black brows drawn together, his nervous hands gripped on the elbows of the chair. There was a slight tap at the door. He did not heed it, being used to mice among the logs and birds twittering overhead. Then the door opened, and a lady came in. Osmond half rose from his chair, and leaning forward, looked at her. He knew her, and yet strangely he had no belief that she was real. It was Rose, a long cloak about her, the hood slipped back from her rich hair. Her face was flushed by the buffeting of the wind, and its moist sweetness tingled with health. It was apparent to him at once that, as he was looking at her in the firelight, she also had fixed his face in the gloom. She was smiling at him, and her eyes were kind. Then she spoke.
<p>"I came to see you, Mr. Osmond Grant."
<p>Osmond was now upon his feet. He drew a chair into the circle of light.
<p>"Let me take your cloak," he said. It seemed to him that no such exciting thing had ever happened.
<p>"No, no. It isn't wet." She tossed it on the bench by the door, and having put both hands to her hair with the reassuring touch that is pretty in women, she turned to him, a radiant creature smiling out of her black drapery. "But I'll sit down," she said.
<p>The next moment, he hardly knew how it was, they were there by the fire, and he had accepted her. She was beautiful and wonderful, a thing to be worshiped, and he lost not a minute in telling himself he worshiped her, and that he was going to do it while he was man and she was woman, or after his clay had lost its spirit. Osmond had very little time to think of his soul, because he worked all day in the open and slept hard at night; but it always seemed to him reasonable that he had one. Now it throbbed up, invincible, and he looked at the lady and wondered again at her. The lady was smiling at him.
<p>"I wanted to meet you," she said, in her soft, persuasive voice. "You don't come to the house any more."
<p>He answered her simply and calmly, with no token of his inward turmoil.
<p>"I haven't been there for some days."
<p>"Is it because I am there?"
<p>"Grannie hasn't needed me."
<p>"Is it because I am there?"
<p>Then he smiled at her, with a gleam of white teeth and lighted eyes.
<p>"I've been a little afraid of you," he owned.
<p>"Well, you're not now?"
<p>"No, I'm not now."
<p>"That's what I came here for." She settled more snugly into the chair, and folded her hands on her knee. He looked at them curiously, their slender whiteness, and noted, with interest, that she had no wedding ring. She continued, "I got breathless in the house. Grandmother was tired and went to bed. Peter has gone to see his cruel lady."
<p>"Why do you call her cruel?"
<p>"She won't hold out her hand to me."
<p>That simple and audacious candor overwhelmed him. He had never known anything so facile yet direct. It made life incredibly picturesque and full of color. He laughed from light-heartedness, and it came into his head that, in her company, it would be easy to believe "as many as six impossible things before breakfast." But she was continuing: -
<p>"Don't you find her cruel?"
<p>"Electra? We haven't exchanged a dozen words in a year."
<p>"Why not?"
<p>"I'm not a notability. It's not remarkable to raise seeds for sale."
<p>"But isn't she cruel?"
<p>He thought a moment, and then answered gravely, -
<p>"She is very opinionated. But she has high ideals. She would be unyielding. Has she been unyielding to you?"
<p>"Hasn't Peter told you?"
<p>"Not a word."
<p>"I came here expecting her to accept me as her brother's wife. She won't do it."
<p>"Won't do it? Does she say so?"
<p>"She says nothing. But she ignores me." Her cheek took on a deeper flush. She did not look at him, and he followed her gaze into the coals.
<p>"You are too proud to give her proofs?" he hesitated.
<p>She stirred uneasily in her chair.
<p>"Proud!" she said bitterly. "If I had been proud, I should never have come here at all. But I am here, and she must recognize me." Some dauntless lines had come into the delicate face and made it older. "It is absurd," she continued, "worse. Here am I living in your house - "
<p>"No! no!" he corrected her. "Not that it matters. It would be yours just the same. But it's grannie's house."
<p>"Taking her hospitality, - oh, it's a shame! a shame!"
<p>"Peter must make it right with Electra," he ventured.
<p>"Peter! He has tried. He has tried too much. Things are not right between them any more. I know that."
<p>Osmond, almost with no conscious will, went back to what he had been thinking when she came in.
<p>"Peter belongs to your Brotherhood - "
<p>"Don't say mine. It is my father's." She spoke with an unguarded warmth.
<p>"But you belong to it, too."
<p>"I used to. I used to do everything my father told me to - but not now - not now!" She looked like a beautiful rebel, the color deepened in her cheeks, her eyes darkening.
<p>Osmond could not question her, but he went back to his own puzzle.
<p>"The trouble is - about Peter - his painting has taken a back seat. He talks about the Brotherhood - little else."
<p>She nodded, looking at the fire.
<p>"I know. I know."
<p>"I've no objection to his believing in the brotherhood of man; but can't the brotherhood of man be preserved if we paint our pictures, and mind our own business generally?"
<p>"Not while my father leads the procession. He will have no other gods before him."
<p>"Tell me about your father."
<p>She turned on him a face suddenly irradiated by fun. An unexpected dimple came to light, and Osmond's pulse responded to it.
<p>"Electra," she said, "found time to propose that I should give a little talk on my father. Last night I lay awake rehearsing it. Do you want to hear it? Markham MacLeod is the chief of spoilers. He preaches the brotherhood of man, and he gets large perquisites. He deals with enormous issues. Kingdoms and principalities are under his foot because the masses are his servitors. Money is always flowing through his hands. He does not divert it, but it has, with the cheerful consent of his followers, to take him from place to place, to shed his influence, to pay his hotel bills - and he must live well, mind you. For he has to speak. He has to lead. He is a vessel of the Lord." She had talked on unhesitatingly, straight into the fire. Now, when she paused, Osmond commented involuntarily, -
<p>"How well you speak." Then as quickly, "Does your father know you think these things?"
<p>"No," she answered. "I have not had occasion to tell him. Not yet! But about Peter." She faced round at him. "Peter is hypnotized by my father, as they all are in the beginning. He won't paint any more portraits while the spell lasts."
<p>"Then he won't get Electra."
<p>"He won't get her anyway, - not if he champions me. That's my impression."
<p>"But what does your father want him to do?"
<p>"Nothing, that I know. It isn't that he chokes people off from other channels. It's just that his yoke is heavy, for one thing, and that they can't do too much for him. Peter has taken him literally. He will sell all he has and give to the poor, and live on a crust. He'll think the chief, too, is doing it; but he'll be mistaken. The chief never denied himself so much as an oyster in his life."
<p>They sat staring at each other, in the surprise of such full speech. Osmond had a sense of communion he had never known. Peter and he had talked freely of many things in the last week, but here was a strange yet a familiar being to whom the wells of life were at once unlocked. The girl's face broke up into laughter.
<p>"Isn't it funny?" she interjected, "our talking like this?"
<p>"Yes. Why are we doing it?" He waited, with a curious excitement, for her answer. But she had gone, darting at a tangent on what, he was to find, were her graceful escapes when it was simpler to go that way.
<p>"It's very mysterious here," she said, glancing about the cabin, "very dark and strange."
<p>"Shall I throw on more wood?"
<p>"If you like. I am not cold."
<p>But he did not do it.
<p>"You don't speak like a Frenchwoman," he ventured.
<p>"I am not. You know that. I am an American."
<p>"Yes; but you have lived in France."
<p>"Always, since I was twelve. But I have known plenty of English, - Americans, too. Shall I speak to you in French?"
<p>He deprecated it, with hands outspread.
<p>"No, no. I read it, by myself. I couldn't understand it, spoken."
<p>She was smiling at him radiantly, and with the innocent purpose, even he, in his ecstasy, felt, of making herself more beautiful and more kind.
<p>"Now," she was saying, "since we have met, you'll come to the house? You won't let me stand in the way?"
<p>His tongue was dry in his mouth. He felt the beauty of her, the pang of seeing anything so sweet and having only the memory of it. Great instincts surged up in him with longings that were only pain. They seemed to embrace all things, the primal founts of life, the loyalties, devotions, hopes, and tragedies. At last he understood, not with his pulses only, but his soul. And all the time he had not answered her. She was still looking at him, smiling kindly now, and, he believed, not cognizant of the terror in his heart, not advertising her beauty as at first he had supposed. She seemed a friend home from long absence. He was speaking, and his voice, in his effort, sounded to him reassuringly gentle.
<p>"We'll see."
<p>"You will come?"
<p>"We'll see."
<p>"Good-night." She wrapped her cloak about her and was gone.
<p>He followed her to the door only, and heard her feet upon the spongy turf. With his impulse to follow farther walked the sane certainty that he ought not to let her find her way alone, even along that friendly road. But he could not do it. The rain had ceased, and there was a moist wind blowing in little temperate gusts, as if it ran over the land and gave it something, and then took brooding interval for another breath. He looked up to heaven, and in the nebulous cloud reaches found a star. So seemed the creature who had dawned in his dark room and lighted it: inaccessible, unchangingly bright, and, if one rashly approached her, armed with a destroying fire.
<p>He went out and sat down upon the bench at his door, turning to lean his forehead against the rough casing. What had happened to him? He did not even own it was the thing that happens to all, the unassuageable longing, the reaching hand for a mate. He had felt safe in his garden ground, where no blossoms opened but innocent velvet ones, temperately, to ripen and then die. But now the portals of the world were wide. He saw beauty, and it roused him to a rage of worship. As the night went on, he grew calmer. Sweet beliefs, a holier certainty stole into that ecstasy of meeting. She seemed again, as she had in one moment of her stay, a dear friend happily returned. The sense of her familiarity was as convincing as if he had known her all his life. It was not recognition alone: it was reunion.
<p>Osmond tried to cease thinking of the beautiful lady until his mind should be more at ease, and to consider Peter, who was acting like a changeling. It seemed possible that he might have to meet his boy bravely, even sharply, with denial and admonition. Peter, he knew, had deliberately put his wonderful gift in his pocket, and under some glamour of new desire was forgetting pictures and playing at the love of man. Playing at it? Osmond did not know; but everything seemed play to him in the divergences of a man who had a gift and stinted using it. If Osmond had had any gift at all, he knew how different it would have made his life. A tragedy of the flesh would have been slighter to a man who felt the surge of fancy in the brain. He had nothing, at the outset, but a faltering will and a deep distaste for any task within his reach. He remembered well the day when he first found Peter had that aptitude for painting, and realized, with the clarity of great revealings, what it meant to them both. All through his boyhood Peter had been drawing, with a facile hand, caricatures, fleeting hints of homely life, but always likenesses. One day he came home from the post-office in a gust of rapture. A series of random sketches had been accepted by a journal. From that time the steps had led always upward, and Osmond climbed them with him. But the day itself - Osmond remembered the June fervor of it when, after a word or two to the boy, surprising to Peter in its coldness, he went away alone and threw himself under an apple tree, his face in the grass, to realize what had come. His own life up to this time had seemed to him so poor that the hint of riches dazzled him. He saw the golden gleam, not of money, but of the wealth of being. Peter had the gift, but they would both foster it. Peter should sleep softly and live well. He should have every luxurious aid, and to that end Osmond would learn to wring out money from the ground. That was his only possibility, since he must have an outdoor life. Then he began his market-gardening. Grandmother was with him always. She even sold a piece of land for present money to put into men and tools, and the boy began. At first there were only vegetables to be carried to the market; then the scheme broadened into plants and seeds. He was working passionately, and so on honor, and his works were wanted. To his grandmother even he made no real confidence, but she still walked with him like a spirit of the earth itself. He knew, as he grew older, how she had drained herself for him, how she had tended him and lived the hardiest life with him because he needed it. There were six months of several years when she took him to the deep woods, and they camped, and she did tasks his heart bled to think of, as he grew up, and looked at her work-worn hands; but those things which bound them indissolubly were never spoken of between them. His infirmity was never mentioned save once when, a boy, and then delicate, he came in from the knoll where he had been watching the woodsmen felling trees. His face was terrible to her, but she went on getting their dinner and did not speak.
<p>"Grannie," he said at last, "what am I going to do?"
<p>She paused over her fire, and turned her face to him, flushed with heat and warm with mother love.
<p>"Sonny," she said, "we will do the will of God."
<p>"Did He do this to me?" the boy asked inflexibly.
<p>She looked at the mountain beyond the lake, whence, she knew, her strength came hourly.
<p>"The world is His," she said. "He does everything. We can't find out why. We must help Him. We must ask Him to help us do His will."
<p>Then they sat down to dinner, and the boy, strengthening his own savage will, forced himself to eat.
<p>He did not think so much about the ways of God as shrewdly, when he grew older, of toughening muscles and hardening flesh. Peter's talents, Peter's triumphs, became a kind of possession with him. Osmond had perhaps his first taste of happiness when Peter went abroad, and Osmond knew who had sent him and who, if the market-garden throve, had sworn to keep him there. The allowance he provided Peter thereafter gave him as much pleasure in the making as it did the boy in the using of it. Peter was like one running an easy race, not climbing the difficult steps that lead to greatness. It looked, at times, as if it were the richness of his gift that made his work seem play, - not Osmond's fostering. But now, coming home to more triumphs, Peter seemed to have forgotten the goal.
<p>He found Osmond one morning resting under the apple tree, his chosen shade. Peter strode up to the spot moodily, angrily even, his picturesque youth well set off by the ease of his clothes. Osmond watched him coming and approved of him without condition, because he saw in him so many kinds of mastery. Peter gave him a nod, and threw himself and his hat on the grass, at wide interval. He quoted some Latin to the effect that Osmond was enjoying the ease of his dignified state.
<p>"I've been up and at it since light," said Osmond, smiling at him. "You don't know when sun-up is."
<p>Peter rolled over and studied the grass.
<p>"Are you coming up to see Rose?" he asked presently.
<p>Osmond could not tell him Rose had been to see him.
<p>"I might," he said, remembering her requisition.
<p>"Come soon. Maybe you could put an oar in. She needs help, poor girl!"
<p>"Help to Electra's favor?"
<p>Peter nodded into the grass.
<p>"You could do it better than I. You can do everything better. You mustn't forget, Pete, that you're the Fortunate Youth."
<p>There was something wistful in his tone. It stirred in Peter old loyalties, old responses, and he immediately wondered what Osmond wanted of him that was not expressed. Osmond had made no emotional demands upon him, as to his profession, but Peter always had a sense that his brother was sitting by, watching the boiling of the pot. This was a cheerful companionship when the pot was active; not now, as it cooled. He threw out a commonplace at random, from his uneasy consciousness.
<p>"Art isn't the biggest thing, old boy."
<p>"What is?"
<p>Now Peter rolled over again, and regarded him with glowing eyes. To Osmond, who was beginning to know his temperament better than he had known it in all the years of the lad's journey upon an upward track, that glance told of remembered phrases and a dominating personality that had made the phrases stick.
<p>"It's to give one man who works with his hands fresher air to breathe, fewer hours' work, a better bed."
<p>"You're an artist, Pete. Don't forget that."
<p>"I don't. But it isn't the biggest thing."
<p>"If you should paint a picture for that workingman to look at while he says his prayers? what then?"
<p>"You don't understand, Osmond," said the boy. "Labor! Labor is the question of the day."
<p>Osmond looked over at a field of seedlings where five men with bent backs were weeding and where he himself had been bending until now. He smiled a little.
<p>"I understand work, boy," he said gently. "Only I can't make hot distinctions. The workingman is as sacred to me as you are, and you are as sacred as the workingman."
<p>Peter was making little nosegays of grass and weeds, and laying them in methodical rows.
<p>"I can't paint, Osmond," he said abruptly. "These things are just crowding me."
<p>"What things?"
<p>"Capital. Labor."
<p>Osmond was silent a long time because he had too many things to say, all of them impossible. He felt hot tears in his eyes from a passion of revolt against the lad's wastefulness. He felt the shame of such squandering. To him, all the steps in the existence by which his own being had been preserved meant thrift and penury. He had conserved every energy. He had lived wholesomely, not only for months, but unremittingly for years. His only indulgences had been the brave temperate ones of air and sleep; and with their aid he had built up in himself the strength of the earth. And here was a creature whose clay was shot through with all the tingling fires of life, whose hand carried witchery, whose brain and eye were spiritual satellites, and he talked about painting by and by.
<p>"What a hold that man has on you!" he breathed involuntarily.
<p>Peter swept his little green nosegays into confusion and sat up. His eyes were brilliant.
<p>"Not the man," he said. "It's not the man. It's the facts behind him."
<p>Osmond's thought flew back to one night, and a girl's reckless picture of her father. It seemed now like a dream, yet it swayed him.
<p>"What can you do for him?" he asked, forcing himself to a healthy ruthlessness. "What have you done?"
<p>"For Markham MacLeod? Nothing. What could I do for him? He has done everything for me."
<p>"What, Pete?"
<p>"Opened my eyes. Made me realize the brotherhood of man. Why, see here, Osmond!"
<p>Osmond watched him, fascinated by the heat of him. He seemed possessed by a passion which could never, one would say, have been inspired save by what was noble.
<p>"You know what kind of a fellow I've been: all right enough, but I like pleasures, big and little. Well, when I began to listen to MacLeod, I moved into a garret the poorest student would have grumbled at. I turned in my money to the Brotherhood. The money I got for the portrait - maybe I shouldn't have asked such a whacking big price if I hadn't wanted that money - I turned that in to the Brotherhood. Would a fellow like me sleep hard and eat crusts for anything but a big thing? Now I ask you?"
<p>Osmond sat looking at him, and thinking, thinking. This, he understood perfectly, was youth in the divinity of its throes over life, life wherever it was bubbling and glowing. Always it was the fount of life, and where the drops glittered, there the eyes of youth had to follow, and the heart of youth had to go. The exact retort was rising to his lips: "That was my money, the money you gave away. I earned it for you. I dug it out of the ground." But the retort stayed there. He offered only what seemed a blundering remonstrance: "I can't help feeling, Pete, that it's your business to paint pictures. If you can paint 'em and give the money to your Brotherhood, that's something. Only paint 'em."
<p>"But you know, I've found out I can speak."
<p>There it was again, the heart of youth on its new track, chasing the glow, whatever it might be, the marsh-lamp or star. Osmond shook his head.
<p>"I don't know, Pete," he owned. "I don't know. I'm out of the world. I read a lot, but that's not the same thing as having it out with men. But I feel a distinct conviction that it's every man's business to mind his own business."
<p>"You wouldn't have us speak? You wouldn't have him, Markham MacLeod?"
<p>The boy's impetuousness made denial seem like warfare. Osmond put it aside with his hand.
<p>"Don't," he said. "You make me feel like Capital. I'm Labor, lad. I always have been."
<p>"Isn't it anything to move a thousand men like one? To say a word and bring on a strike of ten thousand? The big chieftains never did so much as that. Alexander wasn't in it. Napoleon wasn't. It's colossal."
<p>"I don't know whether it seems to me very clever to bring on a strike," said Osmond. "It would seem to me a great triumph to make ten thousand men feel justly. Resistance isn't the greatest thing to me. I should want to know whether it was noble to resist."
<p>"Ah, but it is noble! Resistance - for themselves, their children, their children's children."
<p>Osmond was looking away at the horizon, a whimsical smile coming about the corners of his mouth.
<p>"Yes, Pete," he said. "But you paint your pictures."
<p>"Now you own I'm right! Isn't it anything to move ten thousand men to throw down their tools and go on strike?"
<p>"Well, by thunder!" Osmond had awakened. "Now you put it that way, I don't know whether it is or not. That phrase undid you. Lay down their tools? Show me the man that makes me take up my tools in reverence and sobriety, because good work is good religion. That's what I'd like."
<p>"But it means something, - starvation, maybe, death. You don't recognize it, do you? You won't recognize the war that's on - oh, it is on! - between Capital and Labor, between the high places and the low. It's war, and it's got to be fought out."
<p>"I do recognize it, lad." He spoke gently, thinking of his own lot, and the hard way through which he had come to his almost fevered championship of whatever was maimed or hurt. "Only, Pete, do you know what your opposing forces need? They need grannie."
<p>"To say it's the will of God?"
<p>"To be wheeled out in her chair, and sit at the head of your armies and say, 'Love God. Love one another.' If they love God, they'll listen to Him. If they love one another your strikes will end to-morrow, and your rich man will break bread with your poor one, and your poor one will lose hatred for the rich. You need grandmother."
<p>They sat smiling over it. Peter had amazingly cooled. He rose to his feet.
<p>"Well," he said, "I'll paint some pictures. Of course I'll paint my pictures - sometime. There's the Brotherhood again. Don't I want to turn in shekels? Don't I want to have it known that such weight as my name carries is going in there?"
<p>It was Osmond's turn to rage. He, too, rose, and they confronted each other. Osmond spoke. His voice trembled, it seemed with emotion that was not anger but a fervor for great things.
<p>"I cannot get it through my head. You can do the thing, and it's I that value it. You can paint pictures and you'd prostitute the thing for money, - for reputation. If I had it, if I had that gift" - he paused, and shook his head as if he shook a mane. Peter was looking at him curiously. This was passion such as he had never seen in any man.
<p>"What would you do, old chap?" he asked.
<p>Osmond was ashamed of his display, but he had to answer.
<p>"I would guard it," he said, "as a man would guard - a woman."
<p>They stood silent, their eyes not meeting now, hardly knowing how to get away from each other. As if she had been evolved by his mention of precious womanhood, Electra, in her phaeton, drove swiftly by. They took off their hats, glad of the break in the moment's tension; but she did not turn that way.
<p>"Could she be going to see her?" Peter asked in haste.
<p>"To see her?"
<p>"Rose. She mustn't go now. Rose has gone to the orchard with her book."
<p>He started straightway across the field, and met Electra, returning. As he was standing in the roadway, hat off, smiling most confidently at her, Electra had no resource but to draw up. Before she fairly knew how it had come about, he was beside her, and they were in a proximity for the most intimate converse. Electra felt irritably as if she could not escape.
<p>Peter made up his mind to display, at last, all the guile he had; he would say nothing about Rose. If Electra had attempted to call on her, she might impart the fact to him or not, as she determined. But Electra did not wait to be asked. She turned to him with a serious air, inquiring, -
<p>"When is Miss MacLeod likely to be back?"
<p>"Rose?" Peter countered obstinately. "At dinnertime, surely."
<p>"I shall try to find her then."
<p>Peter felt such an access of gratitude that, as he looked down at the charmingly gloved hands, holding the reins in the right way, he thought of conveying his emotion by placing his own hand over them. But their masterful ease had a message of its own. It seemed almost as if they might resist. He cast about for something to please her.
<p>"Electra," he began, "I'm going to pitch into work with Osmond."
<p>Electra looked at him over a chin superbly lifted. This was evidently surprise, but whether disdainful of him or not he could not tell. At any rate, he felt whimsically miserable under it.
<p>"Osmond works on the farm," she said merely.
<p>Peter inferred some belittling of Osmond, and immediately he was at one with him and market-gardening.
<p>"I belong to the Brotherhood," he said stiffly. "I don't propose to live like a bondholder while other fellows are hoeing. I'm going to work."
<p>Still Electra said nothing. She had meant to stop at her own gate and let Peter leave her, if he would, but she had driven by, and now they were in a pretty reach of pines, with the needles under the horse's feet. The reins lay loosely, and Electra, who seldom did anything without a painstaking consciousness, even forgot her driving, and let her hands relax into an unlawful ease. They might almost tremble, she was afraid, she felt so undone with some emotion, - disappointment, anger? She did not know. But she kept her eyes fixed on a spot directly ahead, and in spite of herself thought turbulently. She could not help feeling that Peter would be surprised if he knew how he seemed to her after this return, almost a stranger, and one who awoke in her no desire for further acquaintance. He was not ministering to her pride in any way. He was not in the least a person whom she could flaunt at gatherings of the intellectually worshipful, with any chance of his doing her credit. She herself had tried to talk art with him, and Peter grew dumb. She could not guess it was because she did not speak his language, which had become almost a sign language, touched here and there with idiom and the rest understood, - a jargon of technicalities, mostly, it seemed, humorous, he appeared to mean them so lightly. Before he went abroad, she, who had read exhaustively in art, used to impart fact and theory to him in a serious fashion, and Peter had humbly accepted them. But now, when she opened her lips about his darling work which was so intimate a part of him that it was almost like play, he had a queer horror of what she was saying, as if she were beginning a persistent solo on a barbarous instrument; he could think of nothing but putting his hands over his ears and running off. But instead he had only been silent. She could not understand Peter's having read so few books and being in possession of such a meagre treasury of formulated opinion. The truth was that he had so many pleasant things to think about that books were only the dullard's task. His thoughts were not very consecutive or toward any particular end; they were merely a pageant of dancing figures, sometimes fantastic, sometimes dramatically grave, but always absorbing. This Electra could not know. Now it was running through her mind that Peter, though he had won the great prizes of art, was mysteriously dull and not what she considered a distinguished figure at all. His air, his clothes even - she found herself shrinking a little, at the moment, from the slovenly figure he made, his long legs drawn up in the carriage so that he could clasp his hands about his knees, while he went brightly on. For now Peter had found something to talk about. His topic shone before him as he handled it. This was almost like painting a picture with a real brush on real canvas, it grew so fast.
<p>"We might found a community," he was urging as warmly, she thought, as if he meant it. "Osmond can dig. I can. I wonder if you could milk the cow!"
<p>"I have certainly never tried to milk a cow," said Electra, in a tone that bit.
<p>But Peter wasn't listening. He was simply pleasing his own creative self.
<p>"You shouldn't," he offered generously. "You should
<p>Electra pulled the horse up, and though this was the narrowest bit of road for a mile, turned, with a masterly hand.
<p>"How under the sun do you do that?" Peter was asking pleasantly. She interrogated him with a glance, and saw him hunched together in more general abandon. The happier Peter was in his own thoughts and the warmer the sun shone on him, the looser his joints became. To Electra he looked like a vagabond, but she was conscious that if for a moment he would act the part of a great painter, she would bid him sit up, try to get him into a proper cravat, and marry him to-morrow. Careless Peter was quite oblivious to the effect he was creating. He had forgotten Electra, save as some one possessed of two ears to listen.
<p>"Turn," he pursued. "How can you turn? I never could. I remember I took you to drive once, ages ago, and I had to keep on in a thunder-shower, round the five-mile curve, because I didn't dare to let you know I couldn't cramp the wheel."
<p>Electra remembered the day. Peter was timidly worshipful of her then, and she had found that quite appropriate in him. She remembered the lightning, and how satisfied she had been to go round the five-mile curve, if only to show that she was not timid in a storm. Then it seemed as if Peter had been unable to forego the delight of having her with him; but now it appeared that he could absently sit there hugging his knees and guying the occasion.
<p>"I believe I can cramp the wheel," he was saying sunnily, out of an absolute content in his limitations. "Only I never can remember which rein does it. Can you turn either way, Electra, right or left, one just as well as the other?"
<p>Electra could not answer in that vein.
<p>"Don't!" she said involuntarily.
<p>In some moods Peter had a habit of not waiting for answers.
<p>"It's beyond me how they do those things," he was saying, "drive, ride, swim. Shouldn't you like to be a fish? I should be mighty proud."
<p>"Shall I leave you here?" asked Electra, drawing up at his gate.
<p>Peter came out of his childish muse. He saw Rose in the garden, and knew it was better that Electra should find her alone.
<p>"Yes, let me out," he said. "I'll run back and see if Osmond is where I left him."
<p>Electra also had seen Rose, lying in the long chair under the grape arbor, and left her carriage at the gate. Rose was in white. A book lay in her lap, unopened. The idle hands had clasped, and her eyes were closed. Electra, coming upon her, felt a pang, an inexplicable one, at her loveliness. It seemed half lassitude, not alone to challenge pity, but a renewed and poignant interest when she should awake. At Electra's step her eyes came open slowly, as if there were nothing in that garden ground to move her. Then with a rush of color to the face, her eyes grew large. Life, surprised life, poured in on her, and she had gained her feet with a spring. Before Electra could insist upon her own decorous distance, Rose, with a charming gesture and an insistent cordiality, had her by both hands.
<p>"How good of you," she was saying. "How good of you!"
<p>"Not at all," returned Electra, with a stiff dignity she hated, as not in the least the armor she had meant to wear. "I came to see if you would drive over to the house." This she had not meant to ask, but it seemed easier to deal with problematic characters in the course of motion than face to face and standing. Rose was eagerly ready.
<p>"My hat is here," she cried, "and my parasol. I thought I might walk up the road a bit, - but it was so hot. How good of you!"
<p>As they went down the path together, Rose in her slender grace and eager motions the significant note in the garden, Electra felt the irritation of having, for any reason, committed herself to even a short intimacy with her. But presently they were together in the carriage, and Electra spoke.
<p>"My grandmother is at home this morning. We have a guest for a few days, Mr. William Stark, of London. I thought you might be interested in meeting them both."
<p>"I shall be delighted," returned Rose, still in that warmly impulsive tone.
<p>Electra had a strong distaste for unconsidered things. They seemed to her to show lack of poise. Now she was conscious of the inconsistency of proposing that Rose should meet anybody, even Billy Stark. But in the moment of conceiving it she had remembered that Mr. Stark was a man of the world; he would know an adventuress when he saw one. Afterwards she would ask him frankly how his judgment had been affected by the siren's song.
<p>At the house she led the way into the vine-shaded sitting-room where Madam Fulton and Stark had been engaged for an hour in a battle delightful to them both. Madam Fulton sat beautifully upright in a straight-backed chair, and her old friend, with her permission, lay upon a bamboo couch, where he held his eyeglass by its ribbon in one outstretched hand and gesticulated with it, while he urged torrentially upon her the rights of a publisher to the confidence of his author. Now he came to his feet and stood punctiliously.
<p>"Ah!" said Madam Fulton. She had remembered a little lack in her reception of Rose when, hot and tired from her journey, she had found her in the house. "So here is our young lady again. I have been wondering why we haven't seen you, my dear."
<p>While Rose, in her grateful sweetness, was bowing over her hand, Electra had said to the gentleman, with the air of its being quite the usual thing to say, -
<p>"You know all about Markham MacLeod, Mr. Stark. This is the daughter of Markham MacLeod."
<p>Somehow, save to Rose, it seemed an adequate presentation, and that instant Stark was bowing before her.
<p>"I can't say Mr. MacLeod," Electra added, with the elaborate grace that fitted what seemed to her that skillful preface. "He is quite too great for that, isn't he, Mr. Stark?"
<p>Billy had no extravagant opinion of Markham MacLeod. He had rather the natural dubiousness of the inquiring mind toward a man whom the world delighted to honor and who had, according to dispassionate standards, done nothing, as yet, save telling others what to do.
<p>"We don't say Mr. Browning often," he concurred, "certainly not Mr. Shakespeare. But, my dear young lady, I don't forgive your father."
<p>He seated himself, for Electra was now decorously smiling in a chair that became her. It had a high carved top like Madam Fulton's, and in these the older woman and the younger looked like the finest-fibred beings bred out of endurance and strong virtues. Rose was in a low chair near Madam Fulton's knee. She was leaning forward now, listening in her receptive way, and Billy Stark looked at her anew and wondered at her beauty and her grace. But he recalled himself with a sigh, and remembered it was the old commonplace - youth - and it was not for him.
<p>"You don't forgive my father?" she repeated, with a slightly foreign accent that came sometimes upon her tongue, no one knew why, whether to enhance her charm or in unconsciousness. "Why?"
<p>Billy Stark had thrown one of his short legs over the other, and held it with his well-kept hand.
<p>"He is a renegade," he said. "He began to write, and stopped writing. You can't expect a publisher to condone that."
<p>Madam Fulton was having a strange pang of liking and envy as she looked at the girl, one such as she never felt over Electra. Rose for her, too, had youth, beautiful and pathetic also. As the girl only smiled without answering, she said kindly, -
<p>"Your father got very much interested in people, didn't he, my dear? the working classes?"
<p>"Labor," said Electra, as if it were a war-cry.
<p>Madam Fulton glanced at her involuntarily, with a satirical thought. Electra had a maternal attitude toward her servants, shown, her grandmother thought, chiefly by interfering in their private lives. She worked tirelessly at clubs to raise money for labor, and she listened to the most arid talks on the situation of the day. But did Electra love her fellowman? Madam Fulton did not know. She had seen no sign of it. But Rose was returning one of her vague answers that always seemed significant, and, to any partial ear, quite adequate.
<p>"My father founded what he calls the Brotherhood. He speaks for it. He works for it. But you know that already."
<p>Stark nodded.
<p>"I know," he said. "It is tremendous. He says to this man 'Come,' and he cometh, and so on. I should think it would make him lie awake o' nights."
<p>"No," said Rose, smiling brilliantly in a way she had when the smile had no honest mirth in it, "my father never lies awake. Responsibility is the last thing he fears."
<p>Now Electra was smiling upon her so persuasively that Rose bent toward the look as if it were a species of sunshine.
<p>"We want you to do something for us," Electra said.
<p>"Oh, I'll do it," Rose was responding eagerly. "Gladly."
<p>"We want you to give us a talk on your father."
<p>Rose, painfully thrown back upon herself, looked her discomfort.
<p>"Do you mean" - she began. "That was what you asked me before."
<p>"For the Club."
<p>"They want me to give a talk on my book," said Madam Fulton, looking at Stark with a direct mirth. Then, still with a meaning for him, she added, to Rose, "You do it, my dear. So will I, if they drive me to it. We'll surprise them."
<p>"That would be very sweet of you, grandmother," said Electra, innocent of hidden meanings. "Then we might count on two afternoons."
<p>"What do you want to know about my father?" asked Rose, and Electra answered with a contrasting enthusiasm, -
<p>"His habit of thought, something about his daily life as seen by those nearest him, anything to interpret a great man to us."
<p>"I can't do it." Rose had answered with a touch of harshness strangely contrasted with her facile ways. "I really can't."
<p>Now she saw why she had been summoned, and her gratitude sobered into dull distaste. She felt cold.
<p>"That sort of thing is very difficult," said Stark, in a general desire to quell the emotional tide. "I often think a person next us has to be inarticulate about us. He doesn't know really what he thinks of us till we are gone. You know a big Frenchman says it is like being inside the works of a clock. You can't tell the time there. You have to go outside."
<p>Rose was upon her feet, a lovely figure, wistful and mysteriously sad.
<p>"I must go back," she said. "Thank you for letting me come." She had turned away when Madam Fulton called to her.
<p>"Miss MacLeod!" Rose stood, arrested. Madam Fulton continued, "Why not stay to luncheon with us?"
<p>The girl did not answer. Apparently she could not. Tears were swimming in her eyes. She looked at Electra in what might be reproach or a despair at the futility of the fight she had to make. She returned to Madam Fulton and stood before her.
<p>"You didn't know," she said, in a low tone. "No one has told you!"
<p>"Sit down," said the old lady kindly. "What is it?"
<p>Rose stood before her, proudly now, her back turned upon Electra, as if she repudiated one source of justice and appealed to another court.
<p>"You called me Miss MacLeod," she said, in her full-throated voice. "I was your grandson's wife."
<p>"Tom's wife!" cried the old lady, in a sharp staccato. "Tom's wife! For heaven's sake!"
<p>Rose turned from her to Stark with an eloquent insistence. Electra, outside the circle of the drama, stood ignored. But Madam Fulton called to her, -
<p>"Electra, do you hear?"
<p>"I have heard it," answered Electra, with composure.
<p>"You have heard it? Why didn't you tell me?"
<p>But Electra made no reply. Madam Fulton gave way to her excitement. It seemed to put new blood into her veins.
<p>"Sit down here," she said imperiously, pushing forward a chair. Rose sank upon it in a dignified obedience. "Now tell me, - how long were you married?"
<p>"Two years."
<p>"Did Tom" - there were many things the old lady, knowing Tom, wished to ask. But Tom was in his grave, and she contented herself with remarking, "I certainly am petrified."
<p>Stark gave a little smiling nod at them, and began making his way to the door. It seemed to him emphatically that this was a family conclave.
<p>"Billy," called the old lady, "did you ever hear of such a thing in your life? Tom had a wife two years before he died, and not a word. Did you ever dream of such a thing? Electra, I could trounce you for not telling me." Then, as no one spoke, she asked sharply, "Does Peter know?"
<p>"Yes, Madam Fulton," Rose returned. "He brought me here. Not quite that. He assured me I might come."
<p>"Come! of course you had to come. You belong here. Why aren't you staying with us? Electra, haven't you seen to it?"
<p>Electra was immovable, and the other girl turned to her a mute glance. To Billy Stark it said many things. Reproach was in it, and a challenging, almost a hard appeal. Rose looked like a gentle thing that has been forced to fight. But she spoke to Madam Fulton.
<p>"I must go," she said, with her exquisite deference. "I mustn't tire you."
<p>"Tire me! I'm never tired. Well, you must come again. You must come to stay. Electra will see to that."
<p>But Electra only walked to the library door with the departing guest, and presently Billy Stark caught the white shimmer of a gown, as Rose went down the path. Electra was looking eagerly from him to her grandmother.
<p>"Well, Mr. Stark," she said, as if she hurried him, "what do you think of her?"
<p>Stark indicated a chair, with a courteous motion, and then allowed himself to be seated.
<p>"She is a remarkably beautiful young woman," he returned, in his impartial way of shedding optimism. Electra made an impatient gesture.
<p>"I know - I know. It's easy enough to be handsome."
<p>"Oh, is it?" commented Madam Fulton.
<p>"But what do you think of her?"
<p>"What do you mean, Electra?" asked her grandmother testily. She was prepared to hear that Electra thought the stranger lacking in poise.
<p>A deep red had risen to Electra's cheeks. Her hands flew together in a nervous clasp. She had momentarily lost what poise she herself possessed.
<p>"Can't you see," she urged, "that girl is an adventuress?"
<p>Grandmother was leaning forward, enchanted at the prospect. She seemed to have before her an absorbing work of fiction, "concluded in our next."
<p>"Now what makes you think so?" she inquired cosily. "Wouldn't that be grand! Stay here, Billy. If there's any scandal about Queen Elizabeth, you must share it."
<p>Electra was speaking with a high impatience.
<p>"Of course she is an adventuress. You must see it, both of you."
<p>"Is that all the evidence you have?" asked the old lady dryly.
<p>Electra blenched a little. She liked to have irrefutable fact on her side, and allow other people the generalities. Yet her certainty remained untouched.
<p>"Does Peter say she is Tom's wife?" inquired Madam Fulton, in some scorn at herself for putting elementary questions.
<p>"Yes. Peter says she was Tom's wife."
<p>"There, you see!" But at Electra's look, the old lady cried out to Stark, in irrepressible annoyance, "No, she doesn't see! It doesn't mean a thing to her."
<p>"It will be quite easy," said Stark soothingly, "to assure yourself, Miss Electra. She will no doubt tell you where she was married. That can be confirmed at once."
<p>"She must present her proofs," said Electra. "I shall not ask for them."
<p>"What do you hate the poor girl for?" asked Madam Fulton. "Is it the money? Are you afraid you've got to share with her?"
<p>Billy Stark had been nearing the door, and now he was out of the room.
<p>"Have you told Peter how you feel about it?" asked the old lady keenly.
<p>Electra seemed to herself to be unjustly upon her own defense when she had meant to place the stranger there.
<p>"He knows it, grandmother." She spoke as impatiently as decorum would allow.
<p>The old lady watched her for a moment steadily. Then she inquired, -
<p>"Do you know what's the matter with you, Electra?"
<p>"With me, grandmother?"
<p>"You're jealous, child. You're jealous of Peter, because the girl's so pretty."
<p>Electra stood still, the color surging over her face. She felt out of doors for all the world to jeer at, and without the blameless habit of her life. Nothing, Electra told herself, even at that moment, had the value of the truth. If she believed herself to be jealous, she must not shirk it, degrading as it was. But she would not believe it.
<p>"You must excuse me, grandmother," she said, with dignity. "I can't discuss such things, even with you."
<p>Madam Fulton spoke quite eagerly.
<p>"But, bless you, child, I like you the better for it. It makes you human. Your decorum is the only thing I've ever had to complain of. If I could find a weakness in you now and then, we should agree like two peas in a pod."
<p>Electra stood taller and straighter.
<p>"At least," she said, "the young woman is here, and we have got to do our best about it."
<p>"The young woman! Don't talk as if she were a kitchen wench. What's the use, Electra! What's the sense in being so irreproachable? Come off your stilts while we're alone together."
<p>"But, grandmother," said Electra, with an accession of firmness, and leaving irrelevant strictures to be considered in the silence of her room, "I shall neither acknowledge her nor shall I invite her here."
<p>"You won't acknowledge her?"
<p>"Not until she brings me proof."
<p>"You won't ask for it?"
<p>"I shan't ask for it. It is for her to act, not for me."
<p>"And you won't have her here? Then, by George, Electra, I will!"
<p>Electra raised her eyebrows by the slightest possible space. It was involuntary, but the old lady saw it.
<p>"You're quite right," she said ironically, "the house isn't mine."
<p>"The house is yours to do exactly as you please with it," said Electra, with an instant justice instinct even with a dutiful warmth. "Any guest you invite is welcome. Only, grandmother, I must beg of you not to invite this particular person."
<p>"Person! Electra, you make me mad. Be human; come, unbend a little. Take the poker out of your training. Do the decent thing, and ask her here, and then find out about her, and if she's a baggage, turn her out, neck and crop."
<p>"I must refuse, grandmother," said Electra. "Now aren't you getting tired? I will bring your food."
<p>Madam Fulton spoke with deliberate unction: -
<p>"Perdition take my food!"
<p>Rose came down out of her chamber after supper on a warm still evening. She had stayed in retirement nearly all day. Grandmother had been suffering discomfort from the heat and was better alone. Peter had gone to town, and he had not come back. The girl stopped in the doorway of the silent house and looked out into the night. It was all moonlight, all mysterious shadows and enchanting stillnesses. The glamour of the hour lay over it like a veil, and her heart responded to the calling from mysterious distances, voices that were those of life itself springing within her and echoing back from that delusive world. She stood there smiling a little, trying to keep the wholesome bitterness of her mood, because she thought she knew what a deceiving jade fortune is, and yet with her young heart pathetically craving life and the fullness of it. Rose thought she had quite fathomed the worth of things. She knew the bravest shows are made by the trickiest design, and she had sworn, in desperate defense of herself, to "take the world but as the world," - a gaming-ground for base passions and self-love. But to-night all the instincts of youth in her were innocently vocal. Here was the beautiful earth, again fecund and full of gifts. She could not help believing in it. She gathered her skirts about her, and stepped out into the dew, and with no avowed purpose, but, straight as inevitable intent could lead her, crossed the orchard and went down across the field to Osmond. She had selected that way, in her unconscious mind, when grandmother had that morning sent her into the attic to look at some precious heirlooms in disuse. Looking out of the attic window she had noted his little shack and fields of growing things, and some impatience then had said to her, That would be the way to get to him. Before the last wall, she came out on a low rise where there was a spreading tree. It was an oak tree, and though there seemed to be no wind that night, the leaves rustled thinly.
<p>"Where are you going?" It was Osmond's voice out of the shadow near the wall.
<p>Rose answered at once, -
<p>"I was going down to see you."
<p>"I thought you would come."
<p>He was sitting there, his back against the wall, and at once she sank down opposite him on a stone that made her a prim little seat. The shadow lay upon her in flecks, but the outline of her white dress was visible to him.
<p>"Did you call me?" she asked. There was no trace of her unrest of the moments before, either in her manner or in her own happy consciousness. She felt instead a delicious ease and security that needed no explaining even to herself.
<p>Osmond answered as if he were deliberating.
<p>"I don't know whether I called you. I hope I didn't. I was thinking about you, of course."
<p>"Why do you hope you didn't?"
<p>"Because I haven't any right to."
<p>"Doesn't my coming prove you had a right to? You see you did call me, and I came."
<p>After a moment he answered irrelevantly, -
<p>"I'm a cowardly sort of chap. When I feel like calling you, I choke it down. I don't want to get the habit of you."
<p>"Why not?"
<p>"One reason - it will be so difficult when you go away."
<p>A sense of freedom and happiness possessed her. Words rose tumultuously to her lips, to be choked there. She wanted to say unreasonably, "I shall never go away. How could you think it?" But instead she asked, with a happy indirection, "Where am I going?"
<p>He, too, answered lightly, -
<p>"How should I know? Back into your cloud, I guess - dear goddess." The last words were very low, and to himself, but she heard them. Instantly and against all reason, she, who had never meant to be happy again, laughed ecstatically.
<p>"Think," she said, "a month ago I didn't know you were in the world."
<p>"Oh, yes, you did. Peter told you he had a kind of a brother, that worked on the farm. But I didn't know you were in the world."
<p>"Of course," she deliberated softly, "I knew Peter had a brother. But I didn't know it was you."
<p>The moonlit air was as beguiling to him as it was to her. Everything was different and everything was possible. He put his hand to his head and tried to recall old prudences. In vain. The still, bright world told him, with a voice so quiet that it was like a hand upon his heart, that it was the only world. The daylight one of doubts and dull expediency had been arranged by man. This was the home of the spirit. For a moment he felt himself drowning in that sea of life. Then, perhaps lifted by his striving will, he seemed to come out again to the free air that had touched him at her coming. Again he was at peace and incredibly exalted. He tried to bring lightness into their talk.
<p>"I suppose," said he, "you are one of the charmers."
<p>"What do you mean by charmers?"
<p>"Don't ask me what I mean, when you know. If you do that, we shall forget our language."
<p>"What do you mean by our language?"
<p>"Yours and mine. Don't you hear it going on, question and answer, question and answer, all the time our tongues are talking? Those are the things we never can speak out loud."
<p>"Yes, I hear them. But I couldn't tell what I hear."
<p>"Of course you couldn't. Only when we really speak with our lips, we must tell each other the truth. If we don't, we shall jar things. Then the other voices will stop."
<p>When she spoke her words had a note of pain, mysteriously disproportioned, he thought, to the warning he had given.
<p>"I don't think I have told you what wasn't true," she faltered. Life had gone out of her.
<p>The tenderest comforting seemed to him too harsh for such pathetic sorrow. But he clung to his lighter, safer mood.
<p>"We've simply got to tell each other the truth. When we don't, it's like the clanging of ten thousand bells. Of course that drowns the other voices. So when I ask you if you are one of the charmers, you mustn't ask what I mean. You must answer."
<p>She began to laugh. His heart rejoiced at it.
<p>"Yes," she owned gleefully. "Yes, I am."
<p>"That's a good lady. You're very beautiful, too, aren't you?"
<p>"Yes," she corroborated. "Oh, I'd swear to anything!"
<p>"If it's true," he corrected her. "What are your accomplishments, missy? Do you play the piano?"
<p>For his life, Osmond could not have told why he addressed her as he did, or how he got the words. Some strange self seemed to have sprung up in him, a self that had a language he had not learned from books nor used to woman. The new self grew rapidly. He felt it wax within him. It was loquacious, too. It seemed to have more to say than there would be time for in a million years; but he gave it head.
<p>"I play a little," said Rose. She was meeting him joyously. "I sing, too."
<p>"Yes, you sing. I guessed that. Let me hear you."
<p>At once she folded her hands on her knees and sang like a child in heaven, with the art that is simplicity. She sang "Nous n'irons plus au bois," and Osmond felt his heart choking with the melancholy of it. His own voice trembled when he said, -
<p>"You must not sing that often. It's too sad."
<p>"Are we never to be sad?" She asked it in a quick tone full of eager confidence, as if whatever he told her was bound to come to pass.
<p>"Not when we are together."
<p>Premonition chilled him there. Why should they ever be together again? Why was it not possible that this was his one night, the first and the last? So if it was to be the last, he would taste every minute of it, and make it his to keep.
<p>"Well," he said consideringly, "so you are a charmer. You can charm a bird off a bush. That would be one of the first tricks."
<p>She answered, in what he saw was real delight, -
<p>"I can try. Want me to?"
<p>"No, no. You can't tell what will become of the bird - in the end."
<p>His voice sounded to her ineffably sad. Eager words rose again to her lips, and again she held them back, even against the glamour of that light and air.
<p>"You broke your promise to me," she adventured presently.
<p>"What promise?"
<p>"You said you would come to the house."
<p>"I said I might." He spoke with an embracing tenderness, as if to a child. She fancied he was smiling at her through the dusk. "Besides," he continued, "I shan't come to see you there, anyway; I have decided that."
<p>"Why not?"
<p>"This is better."
<p>"This?"
<p>"This tree."
<p>It seemed quite just and natural that she should meet him there. Why should she disclaim it?
<p>"But you won't go to the house to see your grandmother?"
<p>"Oh, I see grannie. She wakes before day. We have a little talk every morning while you're asleep. The last time" - he stopped.
<p>"Well!" she urged him.
<p>"The last time I passed your door I heard your step inside. When I went out at the front door, I heard you on the stairs." It had apparently enormous significance to him. "The next morning I came earlier," said Osmond, in a low tone, "but I dropped a handful of rose leaves at your sill."
<p>"I saw them - scattered rose leaves."
<p>"For you to step on."
<p>There was a moment's silence.
<p>"But I didn't," she said. "I didn't step on them."
<p>"What did you do?"
<p>"I gathered them up very carefully in my handkerchief and left them in my bureau drawer."
<p>"Now, why" - he spoke curiously - "why did you do that?"
<p>"I hate to throw away flowers. They are precious to me."
<p>There was silence again, and then he said reprovingly, -
<p>"No, you mustn't do that."
<p>"Do what?"
<p>"You mustn't get up earlier to catch me scattering my rose leaves. That wouldn't be fair."
<p>"That was what I was thinking." She mused a moment. "No, I suppose it wouldn't be fair."
<p>"You see we shall have to play fair every minute. That's the way to be good playmates."
<p>"That's what we are, isn't it - playmates?"
<p>"It's about the size of it." Then he asked her gravely, across the distance between them, "Don't you hear a nightingale?"
<p>She was taken in.
<p>"But there aren't any nightingales in New England!"
<p>"I almost think I hear one. You see if you don't."
<p>She caught the pace then, and listened. Presently she spoke as gravely as he had done.
<p>"I am sure I hear one - over there in the rose garden."
<p>"I knew you would." He breathed quickly, in a gay relief. "Yes, in the rose garden, 'her breast against a thorn.' Well, playmate, it's a wonderful night. I smell the roses, too, don't you?"
<p>"Yes, and lilies. The nightingale sings very loud."
<p>"Let us talk, playmate. Where have you been since I saw you last?"
<p>"Since that other night I came down here?"
<p>"Since that other year, so long ago. We mustn't forget there are other years, though we can't quite recall them. If there hadn't been, we shouldn't be hearing the nightingale to-night and talking without words. You see it's a good while since I saw you. How old are you?"
<p>"Twenty-five."
<p>"Twenty-five! A quarter of a century. That's a long time. Well, what have you been doing all that twenty-five years?"
<p>She seemed to shrink into herself, as if a hand had struck her.
<p>"Don't!" she breathed. "Don't ask me to remember."
<p>"Why, no! not if it troubles you."
<p>"Troubles me! it kills me. Can't we begin now?"
<p>"We will begin now. There, playmate, don't shiver. I feel you're doing it through the moonlight. Don't let your chin tremble either. It did, that night down in the shack."
<p>"When I was talking about Electra?"
<p>"I guess so. Anyway it trembled a lot, and I made up my mind it mustn't any more. Cheer up, playmate. Be a man."
<p>"I wish I were a man." She spoke bitterly. The beauty of the night seemed to break about her, and this castle of whim that had looked, a moment ago, more solid than certainty, was crumbling.
<p>"Now you're doing what I told you not to," he warned her gravely. "You have stopped telling the truth. You don't wish you were a man. Think how happy you were a minute ago, only because you are a beautiful woman and you heard the nightingale."
<p>She was struggling back into the clear medium that had been between them the moment before.
<p>"I only meant" - she spoke painstakingly, hunting for words and pathetically anxious to have them right - "I only meant - I have been unhappy. No man would have been as unhappy as I have been."
<p>Osmond smiled a little to himself, in grave communing. The uphill road of his life presented itself to him as a thorny way so hard that, if he had foreseen it from the beginning, he would have said it was impossible. But at the same instant he remembered where it had led him: he had come out into clear air, he was resting in this garden of delight. And she, too, was resting. He knew that with a perfect certainty.
<p>"We have begun over," he warned her. "We don't have to remember. See the moon driving along the sky. We are going with her, fast. Look at her, playmate."
<p>She looked up into the sky where the moon seemed to be racing past more stable clouds. It was as if their spiritual gaze met there, to be welded into a mutual compact. This was the ecstasy of silence. Presently a sound broke it, a whistle loud and clear from the other field. Osmond was at once upon his feet.
<p>"Come," he said, "we must go. There's Peter."
<p>"But why must we go?" She was struggling out of her trance of quietude, almost offended at his haste.
<p>"Come with me. We will meet him in the field. It is too - too splendid, here. This is our castle under the tree. Don't you know it is? We can't ask anybody in - not even Peter."
<p>"Not even Peter!" She tried to say it gayly, but a quick sadness fell upon her as she rose and went with him along the path. The moon had gone into a cloud, and a breath sprang up. The night was cooler. That other still langour of too great emotion seemed like something generated by their souls, and dissipated when they had to come out of the world of their own creating. All her daily fears rose up before her in anticipation. She was again alien here in her own land, and Electra was unkind to her. But there was a strange confidence and strength in knowing this silent figure was at her side.
<p>"Courage, playmate," he said, as if he knew her thought. "We shall think this night over, shan't we?"
<p>"Yes. When" - her voice failed her.
<p>"Every night," he said, with an unchanged assurance that amazed her like the night itself. "I shall be there every night. If you don't come - why, never mind. If you come" - his voice stopped, as if something choked it. Then he went on heartily, "The house will be there under the tree, the playhouse. Nobody will see it by day, you know. Nobody'll run up against it by night. But you've got the key. There are only two, you know. You have one. I have the other. And here's Peter."
<p>The whistle had come nearer, clear and pure now like the pipe of Pan. Peter stopped short.
<p>"Rose!" he cried. "Osmond! What is it?"
<p>Some accident seemed to him inevitable. Nothing else could have brought about this meeting. Osmond answered, stopping as he did so, when Peter turned to join him.
<p>"I'll go back, now you've come, Peter. We were taking our walks abroad. So we met. Good-night! good-night!"
<p>It seemed a separate and a different farewell to each of them, and he walked away. Peter stood staring after him, but Rose involuntarily glanced up to heaven to see if the moon, out of her cloud now, would give again the radiant assurance of that other moment. She longed passionately for an instant's meeting even so with the man who had gone. Then an exalted calm possessed her. She and Peter were walking rather fast along the path; he had been talking and she was conscious that she had not heard. Now a name arrested her.
<p>"Had you met him before?" he was asking, - "Osmond?"
<p>Her old habit of elusive courtesy came back to her. She laughed a little.
<p>"We haven't really met now, have we?" she responded pleasantly.
<p>"He said he was afraid of you." Peter put it bluntly, out of his curiosity and something else that was not altogether satisfaction. He was not jealous of Osmond. He could not be, more than of a splendid tree; but there was a something in the air he did not understand. He felt himself pushing angrily against it, as if it were a tangible obstruction. "He was afraid of you," he continued blunderingly, "because you are a Parisian."
<p>Rose laughed again, with that beguiling gentleness.
<p>"But he spoke first, I believe," she explained carelessly. "I was walking along and he asked me where I was going."
<p>"What were you talking about?" Peter's voice amazed him, as it did her. It was rough, remonstrating, he realized immediately, like the mood that engendered it. He was shocked at himself and glad she did not answer. Instead, she gave him her hand that he might help her over the low wall.
<p>"See," she said, "your grandmother has a light in her room. She is lying in bed reading good books."
<p>"Does she read them to you?"
<p>"A little word sometimes when I go in to say good-night."
<p>"Grannie's a saint."
<p>"Yes, and better. She's a beautiful grannie."
<p>When they stepped into the hall, Peter, under the stress of his inexplicable feeling, turned to look at her. Instantly the eyes of the man and of the artist agreed in an amazed affirmation. The artist in Peter got the better, and gave him authority.
<p>"Wait a minute," he bade her. "Stand there."
<p>She obeyed him, and looked inquiringly yet languidly. The angry man in him told him at once that she could obey because she was indifferent to his reasons for commanding her. Out of that indifference she stood and looked at him, kind, friendly, yet as far from him as the remoter stars. He stared at her and thought of brush and canvas. Never had he seen a woman so alive. Her eyes, her wayward hair, her very flesh seemed touched with flame. Her lips had softened into a full curve, strange contrast to their former patient sweetness. The pupils of her eyes, distended, gave her face a tragic power. As he gazed, that wild bright beauty seemed to fade. Her eyes lost their reminiscent look and inquired of him sanely. The lips tightened a little. Her languor gave place to a steady poise. Now she shook her head with a pretty motion, as if she cast off memories.
<p>"Do I look nice to-night?" she said kindly, as if she spoke to an admiring boy. "Do you want to paint me?"
<p>Peter turned aside with an exclamation under his breath. He had never, again he told himself, seen a woman so alive, so radiating beauty as if it bloomed and faded while he looked at her. She was beginning to mount the stairs.
<p>"Good-night," she called back to him, with her perfect kindliness. "Good-night, Peter."
<p>Madam Fulton and Billy Stark sat in the library, wrangling.
<p>"I say she'll come," said Madam Fulton.
<p>"I say she won't," replied Billy with a hearty zest. "No woman of self-respect would."
<p>"Maybe she hasn't self-respect."
<p>"Oh, you go 'way, Florrie. Of course she has, any girl as pretty as that."
<p>Madam Fulton looked at him smilingly. There were few left, nowadays, to call her Florrie.
<p>"You see Electra never in the world would have invited her," she continued. "I simply did it, and she had to confirm it or appear like a brute. Electra won't do that. She's willing to appear like a long and symmetrical icicle, but not a brute."
<p>That was it. She had boldly asked Rose to luncheon, and then told Electra she had done it. Now it was fifteen minutes to the time, and the hostess had not appeared. Madam Fulton looked up from her work. There was a laughing cherub in each eye. Her work, let it be said, was no work at all, only a shuttle plying in and out mysteriously, and lyingly doing the deed known as tatting. She usually tied knots and had to begin over; still, as she said, she liked the motion.
<p>"There was a reporter here yesterday," she remarked, watching the effect on Billy.
<p>"The mischief there was! What for?"
<p>"To see me. To ask about the book."
<p>"You didn't talk to him?"
<p>"Oh, yes, I did!"
<p>"What did he ask you?"
<p>"Everything, nearly. He wanted to see the Abolitionist letters I had quoted."
<p>"What did you say?"
<p>"I refused. I told him they were sacred."
<p>"Did he suspect them? Was that his idea?"
<p>"Oh, dear, no! he wanted to reproduce some of the signatures. Then he asked me about my novels."
<p>"What about them?"
<p>"How I used to write them - if the characters were taken from life. I said every time."
<p>"Florrie, what a pirate you are!"
<p>"Then his eyes sharpened up like knives, and he wanted to know about the originals. 'Dead,' I said, 'years and years ago.'"
<p>"You didn't use to be a freebooter, Florrie. You were just a bright girl."
<p>"Of course I didn't. I was walking Spanish then. I was on my promotion. I always had faith life would do something for me if I'd speak pretty and hold out my tier. I held my tier a great many years and nothing dropped into it. I'm an awful example, Billy, of what a woman can become when she's had no fun. This may seem to you insanity. It isn't. It's the abnormal and monstrous fruit of a plant that wasn't allowed to mature at the right time. I am a mammoth squash."
<p>"What did you tell him about your novels?"
<p>"I told him they weren't written. They wrote themselves. My characters simply got away from me and did things I never dreamed of. I said they were more alive to me than people of flesh and blood."
<p>"Do you suppose he put in all that?"
<p>"I know he did."
<p>"Have you seen the paper?"
<p>"No."
<p>"Why not?"
<p>"I haven't dared to look."
<p>Billy Stark glanced at the floor as if he wanted to get down and roll. Then he lay back in his chair and went gasping off. Madam Fulton watched him seriously, that unquenchable spark still in her eyes.
<p>"I don't know what you can do next," said Billy, getting out his pocket-handkerchief, "unless you become engaged to me."
<p>Madam Fulton laid down her tatting, to look at him in a gentle musing.
<p>"It would plague Electra," she owned.
<p>"Come on, Florrie, come on! Get up early to-morrow morning, and we'll post off and be married."
<p>"No," said Madam Fulton absently, still considering, "I don't want to be married. Harsh measures never did attract me. But I'd like very well to be engaged. Tell you what, Billy, we could be engaged for the summer, and when you go back to England we'll call it off."
<p>Billy rose, and possessed himself of one of her hands. He kissed it ceremoniously, and returned it to its tatting.
<p>"You do me infinite honor," he announced, with more gravity than she liked.
<p>"Don't get too serious, Billy," she said quickly. "It'll remind us of being young, and mercy knows that isn't what we want."
<p>"May I inform your granddaughter?" asked the gentleman gravely.
<p>"No, no, I'll do it. That's half the fun."
<p>At that moment Electra came in. She was dressed in white, as usual, but her ordinary dignified simplicity seemed overlaid, to the old lady's satirical gaze, with an added smoothness of glossy surfaces. Her dress fell in simple folds. She seemed to have clothed herself to meet a moral emergency. Her face was pale in its determination. She was like a New England maiden led to sacrifice and bound, at all hazards, to do her conscience credit. Madam Fulton, seeing her, hardened her heart. There were few pirouettes she would not have essayed at that moment to plague her granddaughter.
<p>"Electra, my dear," she said, in a silken voice, "we have something to tell you, Mr. Stark and I. We have become engaged."
<p>Electra looked from one to the other, not even incredulity in her gaze, all a reproachful horror. Yet Electra did not for a moment admit the possibility of a joke on such a subject. She saw her grandmother, as she often did, peering down paths that led to madness, and even, as in this case, taking one.
<p>"Please do not mention it," grandmother was saying smoothly. "The engagement is not to be announced - not yet."
<p>Electra could not look at Billy Stark, even in reproof. The situation was too intolerable. And at that moment, flushed from her walk, eager, deprecating as she had to be in this unfriendly spot, Rose came in. She went straight to Madam Fulton, as if she were the recognized head of the house.
<p>"It was so good of you," she said. "I am so glad to come." Then she turned to Electra and Billy Stark with her quick, beautiful smile and her inclusive greeting. This was not the same woman who had run away to trysts under the tree, or even the woman Peter had seen when she returned, glowing, lovely, as if from a bath of pleasure. She was the Parisian, as Osmond had perhaps imagined her in his jesting fancy, regnant, subtle, even a little hard. Electra felt for a moment as if it were wise to be afraid of her. But they sat down, and she essayed the safe remark, -
<p>"I believe luncheon is late."
<p>"What have you been doing with yourself, my dear?" Madam Fulton asked Rose, who was looking from one to another with an accessible brightness, as if she only wanted a chance to respond to everything beautifully. She bent a little, deferentially, toward Madam Fulton.
<p>"Reading aloud this morning," she said, "to grannie."
<p>"You call her grannie, do you?"
<p>"I begged to. I adore her."
<p>"Does she like it?"
<p>"Oh, yes, she likes it," Rose returned, with her lovely smile. "Don't you think she likes it?"
<p>"I know she does. That's what I can't understand. Every time I hear Electra say 'grandmother' it's like a nail in my coffin."
<p>"Grandmother!" exclaimed Electra, in an instant and quite honest deprecation.
<p>"That's it, my dear," nodded the old lady. "That's precisely it. Nail me down."
<p>Then luncheon was announced, and they went out, Rose with that instant deference toward Madam Fulton which suggested a hundred services while she delicately refrained from doing one.
<p>"I know you," said the old lady dryly, after they had sat down. "I know quite well what you are."
<p>"What, please?" asked Rose, bending on her that warm look which was yet never too flattering, and still promised an incense of personal regard not to be spoiled by deeds.
<p>"I know exactly what you are," said the old lady, with her incisive kindliness. "You're a charmer."
<p>Instantly Rose flushed all over her face, a flooding red. With the word she remembered the other voice out of the moonlit night, telling her the same thing. Now it was almost an accusation. Then it was a caressing loveliness of the night, as if an unseen hand had crowned her with a chaplet, dripping fragrance. In that instant, with a throb of haste and longing, she was away from the circle of these alien souls, back in the night where voice had answered voice. It was immediately as if she were hearing his call to her. "I will come to-night, to-night," she heard her heart repeating. "Did you wait for me last night, dear playmate, alone in the dark and stillness? And the night before? Did you think I was never coming? I will come to-night."
<p>Meantime Billy Stark, seeing the blush and knowing it meant discomfort, was pottering on in his kindly optimism, throwing himself into the breach, and dribbling words like rain. He talked of Paris and continental life in general. Rose had been everywhere. She spoke of traveling with her father on his missions from court to court. When MacLeod's name recurred upon her lips, Electra, who presided, still and pale, roused momentarily into some show of interest. But Rose would not be led along that road. For some reason she refused to speak freely of her father. At a question, her lovely lips would fix themselves in a straight line. Back in the library again, she seated herself persistently by Madam Fulton, like a dog who has at last discovered the person friendliest to him.
<p>"Run away, Billy, if you like," said the old lady indulgently. "You want your cigar on the veranda. I know you."
<p>Billy was going, in humorous deprecation, when there was a running step along the veranda, and Peter came in with a bound. And what a Peter! He looked like a runner - not a spent one, either - with the news of victory. It was in his face, his flushed cheeks and flaming eyes, but chiefly in the air he brought with him - all tension and immoderate joy. Electra held her hands tight together and looked at him. Rose got half out of her chair. In those days when she thought continually of her own affairs, it seemed to her that nothing could be so important unless it had to do with her. Billy Stark by the door waited, and it was Madam Fulton who spoke, irritated at the vague excitement.
<p>"For heaven's sake, Peter, what's the matter?"
<p>He addressed himself at once to Rose.
<p>"I have heard from him. I have had a letter."
<p>"From him!" She was out of her chair and facing him. For the moment, with that hidden communion with Osmond hot in her heart and sharp in her ears, she had almost cried, "Osmond!" But he went on, -
<p>"I have heard from your father."
<p>Instantly the blood was out of her face. Billy Stark wondered at the aging grayness, and reflected curiously that youth is not only a question of flesh and blood but of the merry soul. Peter could not contain his pleasure. He cried out irrepressibly, like the herald beside himself with news, -
<p>"He is coming here!"
<p>"Here!" Rose made one step to lay her hand upon a little cabinet, and stood supporting herself. Electra, who caught the movement, looked at her curiously. Her own enormous interest in Peter's news seemed to merge itself in watchful comment on the other girl.
<p>"Here!" Peter was answering. "To America! He writes me the most stirring letter. I didn't think I knew him so well. He has so many friends here, he says, friends he never saw. He wants to meet them. The best of it is, he's coming here - to us."
<p>"Here!" repeated Rose again. She seemed to be sinking into herself, but the tense hand upon the cabinet kept her firm.
<p>Peter looked at her with eyes of innocent delight.
<p>"Here, to us. I told him if he ever came over, we should grab him before anybody got a hand on him. I've told grannie. She's delighted."
<p>"You told him that!" Her voice held a reproach so piercing that they were all staring at her in wonder. She looked like a woman suffering some anguish too fierce, for the moment, to be stilled. "You've been writing him!"
<p>"Of course," said Peter. "Why, of course, I wrote him. I sent him word when we first got here, to tell him you were well."
<p>"How could you! Oh, how could you!"
<p>At her tone, the inexplicable reproach of it, he lost his gay assurance. Peter forgot the others. There was nobody in the room, to his eager consciousness, but Rose and his erring self; for somehow, most innocently, he had offended her. He took a step toward her, his boyish face all melted into contrition. There might have been tears in his eyes, they were so soft.
<p>"Sit down," he implored her. "Rose! What have I done?"
<p>It was like a sorry child asking pardon. Electra gave him a quick look, and then went on watching. At the tone Rose also was recalled. She shook herself a little, as if she threw off dreams. Her hand upon the cabinet relaxed. Her face softened, the pose of her body yielded, She seemed almost, by some power of the will, to bring new color into her cheeks. Peter had drawn forward her chair, and she took it smilingly.
<p>"I'm not accustomed to long-lost fathers appearing unannounced," she said whimsically. "Dear me! What if he brings me a Paris gown!"
<p>But Peter was standing before her, still with an air of deep solicitude.
<p>"It was a shock, wasn't it?" he kept repeating. "What a duffer I am!"
<p>"It was a shock," said Electra, with an incisive confirmation. "Mayn't I get you something? A glass of wine?"
<p>Rose looked at her quite pleasantly before Peter had time to begin his persuasive recommendation that she should spare herself.
<p>"Let me take you home," he was urging.
<p>It was as if Rose had been drawing draughts from some deep reservoir, and now she had enough to carry her on to victory.
<p>"No, no, Peter," she denied him. "I won't go home. Thank you, Electra," - a delicate frown wrinkled Electra's brows. The girl had never used her familiar name before - "thank you, I won't have any wine. Well, my father is coming. Let's hope he won't turn the country upside down, and keep the trains from running. Get in your supplies, all of you. He may instigate a strike, and if the larder isn't full, you'll starve."
<p>"Stop the trains?" repeated Electra, who was not imaginative. "Why should he stop the trains?"
<p>"Ah, Miss Fulton, you don't know my father," Rose answered gayly. She had seen that tiny frown punctuating her first familiarity, and took warning by it. "Don't you know how, in great gardens, you can take a key and turn on the fountains? Well, my father can turn on strikes in the same manner. He has the key in his pocket."
<p>Electra warmed, in spite of herself.
<p>"I should like" - she hesitated.
<p>"You'd like to see him do it? You may. Perhaps you will. We'll sit in a circle and point our thumbs down and all the bloated capitalists shall go in and be killed." She was talking, at random, out of a tension she might not explain. Billy Stark, the coolest of them, saw that Madam Fulton had some vague inkling of it. Billy, as usual, began talking, but Rose had risen. Having proved her composure, she was going. She listened to Billy with smiling interest, and then when he had finished, humorously and inconsequently, nodded concurrence at him and said good-by. She had a few pretty words for Madam Fulton, a gracious look for Electra, and she was gone, Peter beside her. Billy Stark followed and stayed on the veranda with his cigar. But Electra remained facing her grandmother. She looked at her, not so much in triumph as with a fixed determination. Suddenly Madam Fulton became aware of her glance and answered it irritably.
<p>"For mercy's sake, Electra, what is it?"
<p>Then Electra spoke, turning away, as if the smouldering satisfaction of her tone must not betray itself in her face.
<p>"Do you realize what this means?"
<p>"What what means?"
<p>"She is terrified at his coming - Markham MacLeod's."
<p>"Well, you don't know Markham MacLeod. Perhaps if you did, you'd be terrified yourself."
<p>"But his daughter, grandmother, a girl who calls herself his daughter!"
<p>Madam Fulton stared.
<p>"Don't you believe that either?" she inquired. "Don't you believe she is his daughter?"
<p>"Not for a moment." Electra had turned and was walking toward the door, all her white draperies contributing to the purity of her aspect.
<p>Madam Fulton continued, in the same inadequacy of amaze, -
<p>"But Peter knows it. He knew them together."
<p>"Peter knew her with Tom," said Electra conclusively. "One proof is worth as much as the other."
<p>At the door she turned, almost a beseeching look upon her face, as she remembered another shock that had been dealt her.
<p>"Grandmother!" she said.
<p>"Well!"
<p>"You spoke of Mr. Stark - "
<p>The old lady's thought went traveling back. Then her face lighted.
<p>"Oh," she said. "Yes, I know. I'm engaged to Billy."
<p>"Grandmother - " Electra blushed a little, painfully - "You can't mean - grandmother, are you going to marry him?"
<p>Madam Fulton laid her head back upon the small silk pillow of her chair. She never owned to it, but sometimes the dull hour after luncheon brought with it a drowsiness she was ceasing to combat. She smiled at Electra, who seemed very far away from her through the veil of that approaching slumber and through the years that separated them.
<p>"We shan't marry at once, Electra," she said, dropping off while the girl looked at her. "Not at once. I expect to have a good many little affairs before I settle down."
<p>On the way back to the house, Peter kept looking solicitously at Rose, breaking now and then into quick regrets.
<p>"What have I done?" he asked her, in his impetuous stammer. "Shouldn't I have written to your father? Rose, what have I done?"
<p>She seemed not to hear him. Her face had a strained expression, the old look he remembered from the days of Tom's illness and her not quite natural grief. Then she had never given way to the irrepressible warmth of sorrow, like a loving wife. She had seemed to harden herself, and that he accounted for by his knowledge of Tom's hideous past. The woman had known him, Peter reflected, from illuminating intercourse, and his death meant chiefly the turning of a blotted page. But now! over her bloom of youth was the same shadowing veil. She was not so much a woman moved by strong emotion as made desperate through hidden causes. Still he besought her to forgive him, finally to look at him. Then she wakened.
<p>"It's all right, Peter," she said absently. "It had to be."
<p>But still he saw no reason for her blight and pain. It was not merely incredible, it was impossible that any one should shrink because Markham MacLeod was coming. At the door she did look at him. He was shocked at the drooping sadness of her face. Yet she was smiling.
<p>"Don't bother, Peter," she said. "You've done nothing wrong, nothing whatever."
<p>Then she went up the stairs, and Peter, after watching the last glimmer of her dress, strode away into the orchard and threw himself on the grass. Thoughts not formulated, emotions one yeast of unrest went surging through him, until he felt himself a riot of forces he could not control. It was youth that moved him, his own ungoverned youth, but it seemed to him life, and that all life was like it. Peter thought he had experienced enormously because he had lived in Paris and painted pictures. Yet he had never governed his course of being. It had been done for him. The greatest impression it had made on him thus far was of the extreme richness of things. There was so much of everything! He was young. There was a great deal of time, and if he did not paint his pictures this year, he could do it next. There were infinite possibilities. He had ease and talent and power. He had, even so far, won laurels enough to be a little careless of them. Since he had by the happy pains of art got so much out of life, he made no doubt that by superlative efforts, which he meant to make in that divine future where the sun was always shining, he should set all the rivers afire. There was money enough, too. He had never lacked it, thanks to old Osmond's thrift, Osmond who did not need it himself in the ordinary ways of man. He found such pure fun in the pleasures money bought that there was a separate luxury in giving it up, turning it in to the sum of things, and living straitly that labor might take some ease.
<p>And here he lay on the grass, youth seething within him and pointing like a drunken guide, a vine-crowned reveler, to a myriad paths, all wonderful. His mind wandered to Rose and settled there in a delighted acquiescence. He had never before given himself wholly up to her spell, but now, whether the summer day beguiled him, or whether her mysterious trouble moved him, he thought of her until they seemed to be alone together on the earth, - and that was happiness. Beauty! that was what she meant to him, he told himself when thought was at last uppermost, and not mere passionate feeling. She was delight and harmony, and allegiance to her was like worship of the world.
<p>When he got out of his dream and went in to dinner with the noon sun upon his burning face, she was on the veranda with grannie, a little pale still, but sweet and responsive in the quiet ways she had for every day. Peter, looking at her, felt the sun go out of his blood, and the mad worship of that hour in the orchard seemed like a past bacchanal rout and triumph when the worshipers go home to feed the flocks. His will, recalled, took him by swift revulsion to Electra, but it could not make the journey welcome. She seemed to be far away on some barren plain at the top of climbing. Rose, too, was far away, but the mountain where she lived was full of springs and blossomy slopes, and at the top the muses and the graces danced and laughed. There were flying feet always, the gleam of draperies, the fall of melody, - always pleasures and the hint of pleasures higher still, - and echoes from old joys tasted by gods and nymphs in the childhood of the world. The way there, too, was hard, but what would the path matter to such blisses of the mind and soul? In his daze he became aware that grannie was looking at him kindly.
<p>"I guess you've been asleep," said she.
<p>"He's been dreaming, too," said Rose, in her intimate kindliness, always the same to him as if he were a boy with whom she had a tender and confident relation.
<p>Peter rubbed his eyes.
<p>"I got lost," he said ruefully. "I went up on the mountain and got lost."
<p>"I guess you dreamed it," said grannie. "Come, let's have our dinner;" and they went in together, both the young things helping her.
<p>Peter reflected that Rose had not even heard what he said. She did not care what the mountain was, or whether he was lost. But at the table, while grannie talked about gardening and the things Osmond meant to do another year, and Rose glanced up with involuntary question in her eyes whenever Osmond's name was mentioned, he seemed to have the vision of the mountain again before him and to hear the laughter and the sound of dancing feet. The picture, little by little, faded and would not be recalled, and by afternoon it had quite gone. Sobered, his feet on the earth again, he went away in the early evening, to see Electra.
<p>Rose waited until the dark had really fallen and evening sounds had begun. Then she stole out of the house and, a black cloak about her, this time, went across the fields to the oak tree. At a little distance from it she paused, her heart too imperious to let her speak and find out whether he was there. But when she was about to venture it, a voice came from under the tree.
<p>"Don't stay there, playmate. Come into the house."
<p>Then she went on.
<p>"Where are you?" she asked. There was an eloquent quiver in her voice.
<p>"Never mind. I'm in the house. Stop where you are. There's a little throne. I made it for you."
<p>She had her hand on the back of a rough chair. At once she seated herself.
<p>"I never heard of a throne in a playhouse," she said, with that new merriment he made for her.
<p>"You never saw a playhouse just like this. That's a beautiful throne. It fits together like a chair. It's here in the playhouse by night, but before daylight I draw it up into the tree and hide it."
<p>"What if somebody finds it?"
<p>"They'll think it's a chair."
<p>"What if they break it?"
<p>"That's easy. We'll make another. There's nothing so easy as to make a throne for a playhouse, if you know the way. Well, playmate, how have you been, all this long time?"
<p>When she came across the field she had meant to tell him how sad she was, how perplexed, how incapable of meeting the ills confronting her. But immediately it became unnecessary, and she only laughed and said, -
<p>"It hasn't been a long time at all."
<p>"Hasn't it? Oh, I thought it had!"
<p>"Have you been here every night?"
<p>"Every night."
<p>"But it rained."
<p>"I know it, outside. It doesn't rain in a playhouse."
<p>"Did you truly come?"
<p>"Of course. What did I tell you? I said 'every night.'"
<p>"Did you have an umbrella?"
<p>"An umbrella in a playhouse? You make me laugh."
<p>"You must have got wet through."
<p>"Not always. Sometimes I climbed up in the branches - in the roof, I mean. You're eclipsed to-night, aren't you?"
<p>"What do you mean?"
<p>"That dark cloak. The other night you were a white goddess sitting there in the moonlight. You were terribly beautiful then. It's almost a shame to be so beautiful. This is better. I rather like the cloak. You're nothing but a voice to-night, coming out of the dark."
<p>Immediately she had a curious jealousy of the white dress that made her beautiful to him when he did not really know her face.
<p>"You have never seen me," she said involuntarily.
<p>"Oh yes, I have. In the shack, that night. Then the day you came. I saw you driving by."
<p>"Where were you?"
<p>"In the yard looking at some grafted trees. Peter was late from the train. I got impatient, so I went round fussing over the trees, to keep myself busy. Then you came up the drive, and I saw you and retreated in good order."
<p>"You needn't have hated me so. You hadn't really seen me."
<p>"I saw enough. I saw your cheek and one ear and the color of your hair. Take care, playmate, you mustn't do that."
<p>"What?"
<p>"You mustn't say I hated you. You know it wasn't hate."
<p>Some daring prompted her to ask, "What was it, then?" but she folded her hands and crossed her feet in great contentment and was still.
<p>"Tell me things," she heard him saying.
<p>"What things? About the house up there? About grannie? About Peter?"
<p>"No, no. I know all about grannie and Peter. Tell me things I never could know unless we were here in the playhouse, in the dark."
<p>Her mind went off, at that, to the wonder of it. She was here in strange circumstances, and of all the occurrences of her life, it seemed the most natural. Immediately she had the warmest curiosity, the desire that he should talk inordinately and tell her all the things he had done to-day, yesterday, all the days.
<p>"You tell," she said. "Begin at the beginning, and tell me about your life."
<p>"Why, playmate!" His voice had even a sorrowful reproach. "There's nothing in it. Nothing at all. I have only dug in the ground and made things grow."
<p>"What people have you known?"
<p>"Grannie."
<p>"She isn't people."
<p>"She's my people. She's all there is, except Peter, and he hasn't been here."
<p>Something like jealousy possessed her. She was stung by her own ignorance.
<p>"But there are lots of years when we didn't meet," she said.
<p>"Lots of them. But I don't care anything about them. I told you so the other night."
<p>"Don't you care about mine?"
<p>"Not a bit."
<p>She was lightheaded with the joy of it. There were things she need not tell him.
<p>"Not the years before we met?" Then because she was a woman, she had to spoil the cup. "Nor the years after I go away?"
<p>"No, not the years when you've gone away. You can't take this night with you, nor the other night."
<p>He had hurt her.
<p>"That's enough, then - a memory."
<p>Osmond laughed a little. It was a tender sound, as if he might scold her, but not meaning it.
<p>"You mustn't be naughty," he said. "There's nothing naughtier in a playhouse than saying what isn't true. You know if you go away you'll come back again. You can't help it. It may be a long time first. You were twenty-five years in coming this time. But you'll have to come. You know that, don't you?"
<p>"Yes," she said gravely, "I know that." Then the memory of her wandering life and the sore straits of it voiced itself in one cry, "I don't want to go. I want to stay."
<p>"Stay, dear playmate," said the other voice. "There never will be a night when I'm not here. Is the playhouse key in your hand, all tight and warm? I wear mine round my neck. We shan't lose them."
<p>Immediately she felt that she must tell him her new trouble.
<p>"My father is coming here," she said, in a low tone.
<p>"Ah!" he answered quickly. "You won't like that."
<p>"How do you know?"
<p>"From what you said the other night. You don't like him."
<p>"Is it dreadful to you, if I don't like my father?"
<p>She put it anxiously, with timidity, and he answered, -
<p>"It's inevitable. He hasn't treated you well."
<p>She was staring at him through the darkness, though she could see nothing.
<p>"You are a wizard," she said, "a wizard. Why do you say he has not treated me well?"
<p>"Because I see how you hate him. You would never hate without reason. You are all gentleness. You know you are. You'd go on your knees to the man that was your father, and beg him to be good enough so you could love him. And if you couldn't - George! that settles him. Why, playmate, you're not crying!"
<p>She was crying softly to herself. But for a little unconsidered sniff he need not have known it.
<p>"I like to cry," she said, in a moment. "I like to cry - like this."
<p>"It's awful," said the other voice, apparently to itself, "to make you cry and not know how to stop you. Don't do it, playmate!"
<p>She laughed then.
<p>"I won't cry," she promised. "But if you knew how pleasant it is when it only means somebody understands and likes you just as well - "
<p>"Better," said the voice. "I always like you better. Whatever you do, that's the effect it has. Now let's talk about your father. We can't stop his coming?"
<p>"No. Nobody ever stopped him yet in anything."
<p>"Then what can we do to him after he gets here?"
<p>"That's what I am trying to think. Sometimes I'm afraid I must run away - before he comes."
<p>"Yes, playmate, if you think so." There was something sharp in the tone: a quick hurt, a premonition of pain, and it was soothing to her.
<p>"But I've so little money." She said that to herself, and his answer shocked her.
<p>"There's money, if that's all. I'll bury it here under a stone, and you shall find it."
<p>"No! no! no! How could you! oh, how could you!"
<p>The voice was hurt indeed now, and willing to be thought so.
<p>"Why, playmate, is that so dreadful? Money's the least important thing there is."
<p>"It is important," said she broodingly. "It seems to me all my miseries, my disgraces have come from that."
<p>"You don't want to tell me about them? You don't think it would make them better?"
<p>"You said you didn't care. You said what we had lived through - what I had - these twenty-five years, made no difference!"
<p>"Not to me. But when it comes to you, why, maybe I could help you."
<p>She thought a while and then answered definitely and coldly, -
<p>"No, I can't do it. I should have to tell - too many things."
<p>"Then we won't think of it," said the voice. "Only you must remember, there's money and there's - Peter to take you off and hide you somewhere. You can trust Peter." Again he seemed ready to break their companionship, and she wondered miserably.
<p>"You seem to think of nothing but my going away."
<p>"I must think of it. Nothing is more likely."
<p>"You don't seem to care!"
<p>"Playmate!" Again the voice reproached her.
<p>"Well!"
<p>"There's but one thing I think of - really. To give you a little bit of happiness while you are here. After that - well, you can make the picture for yourself. I shall come to the playhouse every night - alone."
<p>The one thing perhaps that had been the strongest in guiding her romantic youth had been eternal faithfulness. Her heart beat at the word "forever." Now her gratitude outran his calm.
<p>"Will you do it?" she cried.
<p>"Shall I promise?"
<p>"No! no! I would not have you do it really - only want to do it. Do you think you will remember - to want to come?"
<p>He said the words after her, so slowly that they seemed to come from lips set with some stern emotion.
<p>"I shall remember. I shall want to come."
<p>She rose.
<p>"Good-night," she said. "Shake hands?"
<p>"No," said the voice, "not that. In playhouses you can't shake hands. Good-night - dear lady."
<p>She turned away, and then, because she was silent the voice called after her, -
<p>"Playmate!"
<p>"Yes."
<p>"I shall follow you to the wall and watch you home. You're not afraid?"
<p>"No, I'm not afraid."
<p>"And you're almost happy?"
<p>At the anxiety in his voice, she was unreasonably happy.
<p>"Yes," she called back. "Good-night."
<p>"Got the key safe?"
<p>"All safe. Good-night."
<p>"God bless you, playmate." That was what she thought she heard.
<p>Madam Fulton was at the library table, considering her morning mail, and Billy Stark sat on the veranda just outside the window where she could call to him and be cheerfully answered. Presently Electra came in, a book, a pencil, and some slips of paper in her hand. There was intense consideration on her brow. She had on, her grandmother thought with discouragement, her clubwoman's face. Billy Stark, seeing her, got up and with his cigar and his newspaper wandered away. He had some compassion for Electra and her temperament, though not for that could he abstain from the little observances due his engagement to Madam Fulton. He had a way of bringing in a flower from the garden and presenting it to the old lady with an exaggerated significance. Electra always winced, but Madam Fulton was delighted. He called her "Florrie," prettily, and "Florrie, dear." Again Electra shrank, and then he took the wrinkled hand. One day Madam Fulton looked up at him with a droll mischief in her eyes.
<p>"I suppose it's an awful travesty, isn't it, Billy?"
<p>"Not for me," said Billy loyally. "Can't I be in love with a woman at the end of fifty years? I should smile."
<p>"It's great fun," she owned. Then more than half in earnest, "Billy, do you suppose I shall go to hell?"
<p>This morning Electra had found something to puzzle her.
<p>"I've been working on your book a little, grandmother," she began.
<p>"What book? My soul and body!" The old lady saw the cover and laid down her pen. "That's my 'Recollections.' What are you doing with that?"
<p>"They are extremely interesting," said Electra absorbedly. She sat down and laid her notes aside, to run over a doubtful page. "We are going to have an inquiry meeting on it."
<p>"We? Who?"
<p>"The club. Everybody was deeply disappointed because you've refused to say anything; but it occurred to us we might give an afternoon to classifying data in it, naming people you just refer to, you know. I am doing the Brook Farm section."
<p>Madam Fulton sank back in her chair and looked despairingly from the window for Billy Stark.
<p>"I shall never," she said, "hear the last of that book!"
<p>"Why should you wish to hear the last of it?" asked Electra. "It is a very valuable book. It would be more so if you would only be frank about it. But I can understand that. I told the club it was your extreme delicacy. You simply couldn't mention names."
<p>"No, I couldn't," murmured the old lady. "I couldn't."
<p>"But here is something, grandmother. You must help me out here. Here where you talk about the crazy philanthropist who had the colonization scheme - not Liberia - no, that's farther on - Well, you say he came to grandfather and asked him to give something to the fund." She was regarding Madam Fulton with clear eyes of interrogation.
<p>"No, no, I don't remember," said the old lady impatiently. "Well, go on."
<p>"You don't remember?"
<p>"Yes, yes, of course I remember, in a way. But go on, Electra."
<p>"Well, then the philanthropist asked him to be one of the five men who would guarantee a certain sum at their death, and grandfather was indignant and said, 'Charity begins at home.' Listen." She found her page and read, "'I shall assuredly leave every inch of ground and every cent I possess to my wife, and that, not because she is an advanced woman but because she is not.'"
<p>"Of course!" corroborated the old lady. "Precisely. There's a slap at suffrage. That's what I mean it for, and you can tell 'em so."
<p>Electra did not stop to register her pain at that. She held up one hand to enjoin attention.
<p>"But listen, grandmother. You don't see the bearing of it yet. That was five years after grandfather made his will, leaving this place away from you."
<p>"Well, what of it?"
<p>"Five years after, grandmother! And here, by his expressed intention, he meant to leave it to you - not to his son, but you. Do you see what that implies?"
<p>"I don't know what it implies," said the old lady, "but I know I shall fly all to pieces in about two minutes if you don't stop winding me up and asking me questions."
<p>Electra answered quite solemnly, -
<p>"It means, grandmother, that legally I inherited this place. Ethically it belongs to you. My grandfather meant to make another will. Here is his expressed intention. He neglected doing it, as people are always neglecting things that may be done at any time. It only remains for me to make it over to you."
<p>Madam Fulton lay back in her chair for a moment and stared. She seemed incapable of measuring the irony she felt. But Electra went quietly on, -
<p>"There is simply nothing else for me to do, and I shall do it."
<p>Madam Fulton gasped a little and then gave up speaking. Again she glanced at the window and wished for Billy Stark. Electra was observing her compassionately.
<p>"It excites you, doesn't it?" she was saying. "I don't wonder."
<p>Now the old lady found her tongue, but only to murmur, -
<p>"I can't even laugh. It's too funny; it's too awfully funny."
<p>"Let me get you a little wine." Electra had put her papers together and now she rose.
<p>Then Madam Fulton found her strength.
<p>"Sit down, Electra," she said. "Why, child, you don't realize - I don't know what you'd do if you did - you don't realize I put that in there by the merest impulse."
<p>"Of course," said Electra kindly. "I understand that. You never dreamed of its having any bearing on things as they are now, they have gone on in this way so long. But it would be shocking to me, shocking, to seem to own this house when it is yours - ethically."
<p>"Don't say ethically. I can't stand it. There, Electra! you're a good girl. I know that. But you're conscience gone mad. You've read George Eliot till you're not comfortable unless you're renouncing something. Take things a little more lightly. You can if you give your mind to it. Now this - this is nothing but a joke. You have my word for it."
<p>"It isn't a joke," said Electra firmly, "when grandfather could write that over his own signature and send it to a well-known person. How did it come back into your hands, grandmother?"
<p>But Madam Fulton looked at her, wondering what asylum Electra would put her in, if she knew the truth. She essayed a miserable gayety.
<p>"Very well, Electra," she smiled, "call it so, if you like, but we won't say any more about it. I can't have houses made over to me. I may totter into the grave to-morrow."
<p>Electra's eyes went involuntarily to the garden where Billy Stark was placidly walking up and down, smoking his cigar and stopping now and then to inspect a flower. The old lady interpreted the look.
<p>"I know, I know," she said wickedly; "but that's nothing to do with it. Besides, if I marry Billy Stark, I shall go to London to live. What do I want of houses? Let things be as they are, Electra. You keep the house in your hands and let me visit you, just as I do now. It's all one."
<p>Electra spoke with an unmoved firmness. Her face had the clarity of a great and fixed resolve.
<p>"The house is yours; not legally, I own, but - "
<p>"Don't you say ethically again, Electra," said the old lady. "I told you I couldn't bear it."
<p>She sank back still further into her chair and glared. At last Madam Fulton was afraid of her own emotions. Such amazement possessed her at the foolish irony of things, such desire of laughter, that she dared not yield lest her frail body could not bear the storm. Man's laughter, she realized, shout upon shout of robust roaring, was not too heroic for this folly. Electra was speaking: -
<p>"I insist upon the truth from others," she said, still from a basic resolution that seemed invulnerable. "I must demand it from myself."
<p>"The truth, Electra!" groaned Madam Fulton. "You don't tell the truth."
<p>"I don't tell the truth?"
<p>"You don't know anything about it. You've thought about it so much that now you only tell horrible facts."
<p>This Electra could not fathom, but it was evident that she was putting it away in her consciousness for a thoughtful moment. Madam Fulton was rallying. She felt a little stronger, and she knew she was mentally more vigorous than her young antagonist. It was only in an unchanging will that Electra distanced her.
<p>"Electra," she said, "you've got to be awfully careful of yourself." There was a wistful kindness in her voice. It was as if she spoke to one whom she wished to regard leniently, though she might in reality shower her with that elfin raillery which was the outcome of her own inquietude.
<p>Electra opened her eyes in a candid wonder.
<p>"Careful of myself?" she repeated. "Why, grandmother?"
<p>"You've trained so hard, child. You've trained down to a point where it's dangerous for you to try to live."
<p>"Trained down, grandmother? I am very well."
<p>"I don't mean your body. I mean, you've thought of yourself and your virtues and your tendencies, and tested yourself with tubes and examined yourself under a glass until you're nothing but a bundle of self-conscious virtues. Why, it would be better for you if you were a care-free spontaneous murderess. You'd be less dangerous."
<p>"Suppose we don't talk about it any more," said Electra, in that soothing accent suited to age.
<p>"But I've got to talk about it. I never have done any particular duty by you, but I suppose the duty's there. I've got to tell you when you sail into dangerous latitudes. You mark my words, Electra, assure as you sit there, you've trained so hard that there's got to be a reaction. Some day you'll fly all to pieces and make an idiot of yourself."
<p>Electra had risen.
<p>"Excuse me for a moment, grandmother," she said. "I must get you a glass of wine."
<p>Madam Fulton, too, got up and rested one hand upon the table.
<p>"If you leave the room before I've finished," she cried, "I'll scream it after you." A small red spot had come upon each cheek. She looked like a fairy god-mother, a pinpoint of fury in the eye. "I insist upon your listening. God Almighty meant you for a handsome, well-behaved woman. You're not clever. There's no need of your being. But you've made yourself so intelligent that you're as dull as death. You've cultivated your talents till you've snapped them all in two. You've tried so hard to be a model of conduct that you're a horror, a positive horror. And you mark my words, the reaction will come and you'll do something so idiotic that you won't know yourself. And then when you're disgraced and humble, then will be the time I shall begin to like you."
<p>She was shaking all over, and Electra looked at her in great alarm. She dared not speak lest the paroxysm should come again. A little new gleam sprang into Madam Fulton's eyes. At last she realized that she had, though by ignoble means, quite terrified her granddaughter. That one humorous certainty was enough, for the time, to mitigate her plight. She drew a quick breath, and shrugged her shoulders.
<p>"There!" said she. "It's over. I don't know when I've had such a satisfying time. Run along, Electra. It won't happen again to-day." Then it occurred to her that she was foregoing an advantage, and she added shrewdly, "Though it might at any minute. But if you bring me anything to take, anything quieting or restorative, I'll throw it out of the window."
<p>Electra, relieved slightly at the lulling of the storm, looked delicately away from her and out at the peaceful lawn. She would have been sorry to see again the red of anger in those aged cheeks. Her gaze hung arrested. Inexplicable emotion came into her face. She looked incredulous of what so fired her. Madam Fulton sat down again, breathing relief at the relaxing of her inward tension, and she too looked from the window. A man, very tall and broad, even majestic in his bearing, stood talking with Billy Stark. Billy, with all his air of breeding and general adaptability, looked like comedy in comparison.
<p>"Grandmother!" Electra spoke with a rapid emphasis, "do you know who that is?"
<p>"No, I'm sure I don't."
<p>"It is Markham MacLeod."
<p>"What makes you think that?"
<p>"I know him. I know his picture. I know that bust of him. He is here before Peter expected."
<p>Life and color came into her face. She laid down her book and papers, and went with a sweeping haste to the hall-door. Billy was coming with the stranger up the path, and MacLeod, glancing at the girl's waiting figure, took off his hat and looked at her responsively. Electra's heart was beating as she had never felt it beat before. Greatness was coming to her threshold, and it looked its majesty. MacLeod had a tremendous dignity of bearing added to the gifts nature had endowed him with at the start. He was a giant with the suppleness of the dancer and athlete. His strong profile had beauty, his florid skin was tanned by the sea, his blue eyes were smiling at Electra, and in spite of the whiteness of his thick hair he did not seem to her old. She would have said he had the dower of being perennially young. Meantime Billy Stark, who had known him at once from his portraits, had named him to her, and the great man had taken her hand. He had explained that he was in advance of his time, that he had driven to Peter's and had been told that the young man was probably here. So he had strolled over to find him.
<p>"He is not here," said Electra. "Please come in." She was breathless with the excitement of such notability under her roof. She led the way to the sitting-room, judging hastily that grandmother was too shaken by her mysterious attack to see a stranger, and also even tremblingly anxious to speak with him before any one could share the charm. MacLeod followed her, offering commonplaces in a rich voice that made them memorable, and Billy stayed behind to throw away his cigar, and debate for an instant whether he need go in. Then he heard a voice from the library softly calling him.
<p>"Billy, I want you."
<p>He stepped in through the long window, and there was Madam Fulton, half laughing, half crying, and shaking all over. He ran to her in affectionate alarm.
<p>"Billy," said she, "I've had a temper fit."
<p>Billy put his arm about her and took her to the sofa. There he sat down beside her, and she dropped her head on his shoulder.
<p>"Shoulders are still very strengthening, Billy," said she, laughing more than she cried, "even at our age."
<p>"They're something to lean on," said Billy. "There! there, dear! there!"
<p>Presently she laughed altogether, with no admixture of tears, and Billy got out his handkerchief and wiped her face. But she still shook, from time to time, and he was troubled for her.
<p>"Now," she said presently, withdrawing from him and patting her white hair, "Now I think we've weathered it."
<p>"What was it?" ventured Billy.
<p>"I can't tell you now. I might die a-laughing. But I will." She rested her hand on his shoulder a moment before she went away. "I'll tell you what it is, Billy," she said, "the beauty of you is you're so human. You're neither good nor bad. You're just human."
<p>Markham Macleod's great advantage, after that of his wonderful physique, was his humility. A carping humorist, who saw him dispassionately, the more so that women were devoted to "the chief," said that humility was his long suit. There was his splendid body, instinct with a magnetic charm. He was born, charlatans told him, to be a healer. But he deprecated his own gifts. With a robust humor he disclaimed whatever he had done, and listened to other voices, in specious courtesy. Now, face to face with Electra, he had convinced her in five seconds that it was an illuminating thing to come to America and find her there. This was more than the pliancy of the man of the world. It seemed to her the spontaneous tribute of a sincere and lofty mind. As for her, she was abounding in a tremulous satisfaction.
<p>"You have not been in America for a long time," she was saying.
<p>"Not for years. I have been too busy to come."
<p>"You are needed over there."
<p>She glowed the more, and he looked upon her kindly as a handsome young woman whose enthusiasm became her.
<p>He smiled and shook his head.
<p>"I don't know whether they wanted me so much. I needed them."
<p>"Your brothers, you mean. The units that make your brotherhood."
<p>She was quoting from his last reported speech, and her spirits rose as she felt how glad she was to have been ready. It seemed to her that there were so many things she had to say at once that they would come tumultuously. MacLeod, when his position was assured, was quite willing to let the disciple talk. It was only over ground not yet tilled that his eloquence fell like rain. And Electra, leaning toward him in a brilliant, even a timid expectation, was saying, -
<p>"Tell me about Russia. What do you foresee?"
<p>A reporter had asked him the same question a few hours before, and the answer would be in the evening paper. He smiled at her, and spread out his hands in a disclaiming gesture.
<p>"You know what I foresee. You know what you foresee yourself. It is the same thing."
<p>"Yes," said Electra, "it is the same thing."
<p>But there were times when MacLeod wanted to escape from posturing, even though it brought him adulation.
<p>"I haven't apologized for breaking in on you like this," he said, with his engaging smile. "They told me at Grant's that I should probably find him over here, in the garden. The next house they said. This is the next house?"
<p>"Oh, yes," returned Electra. "He has not been here, but I will send for him. He shall come to luncheon. You must stay."
<p>"Shall I?" He was all good-nature, all readiness and adaptability. Electra excused herself to give the maid an order, and while she stood in the hall, talking to the woman, temptation came upon her. Yet it was not temptation, she told herself. This was the obvious thing to do.
<p>"Tell Mr. Grant I wish him particularly to come to luncheon," she said, "and to bring" - she hesitated at the name and shirked it, "and to bring the young lady, - the lady who is staying there."
<p>Then she returned to MacLeod. But she was not altogether at ease. Electra was accustomed to examine her motives, and she had the disquieting certainty that, this time, though they would do for the literal eye, they had not been entirely pure. Still, was it her fault if Rose, confronted by the newcomer, proved unprepared and showed what was fragile in her testimony? But she was not to be thrown off the scent of public affairs.
<p>"Talk about Russia," she entreated. She had never felt so spontaneously at ease with any one.
<p>MacLeod was used to making that impression, and he smiled on her the more kindly, seeing how the old charm worked.
<p>"I'd rather talk about America," he said, "about this place of yours. It's a bully place."
<p>Electra was devoted to academic language, and to her certainty that all great souls expressed themselves in it. She winced a little but recovered herself when he asked with a new conversational seriousness, "and how is my friend Grant?"
<p>"Well." She found some difficulty in answering more fully, because it somehow became apparent to her that he had not really placed her. Peter was his only clue in the town. It hardly looked as if he expected to find a daughter here.
<p>"Is he painting?" MacLeod went on.
<p>Electra frowned a little. Peter was doing nothing but idling, she suspected, up to yesterday, and then, driving past, she had caught a glimpse of him in the garden before a canvas and of Rose lying before him in her long chair. That had given her a keener, a more bitter curiosity than she was prepared for in herself. She had shrunk back a little from it, timid before the suspicion that she might like Peter more tempestuously and unreasonably than was consonant with self-mastery. But while these thoughts ran through her head she gazed at MacLeod with her clear eyes and answered, -
<p>"I fancy he looks upon this as his vacation. He must have worked very hard in Paris."
<p>MacLeod entered into that with fluency. Peter must have worked hard, he owned, but that was in the days before they met. When they met, Peter's talent was at its blossoming point. It was more than talent. It was genius, it was so free, so strong, so unconsidered. He implied that Peter had everything that belonged to a fortunate youth.
<p>Electra's eyes glowed. Here was some one to justify her choice. The newspapers had done it, but she had not yet heard Peter's praises from the mouth of man.
<p>"You have had an enormous influence over him," she ventured.
<p>He deprecated that.
<p>"He has an enormous affection for me, if you like," he owned, "but influence! My dear young lady, I couldn't influence a nature like that. I'm nowhere beside it. All I could hope for is that it would think some of the things I think, feel some of the things I feel. Then we could get on together."
<p>Billy Stark, coming in at the door, thought that sounded like poppycock, but Electra knew it was the wisdom of the chosen. She rose and indicated Billy.
<p>"You know Mr. Stark?"
<p>The two men recurred humorously to their meeting in the garden, and owned their willingness to continue the acquaintance. At the moment there were steps and MacLeod turned to see Rose coming into the room. Electra's heart beat thickly. She felt choked by it. And there was, she could not help owning, a distinct drop of disappointment when MacLeod, with an exclamation of delighted wonder, went forward and kissed Rose on the cheek. Then he kept her hand while he gave the other one to Peter, and regarded them both with expansive kindliness. Rose was the one who had blenched under the ordeal. Yet she had herself immediately in hand. She let her fingers stay in MacLeod's grasp. She looked at him, not affectionately nor in pride, but with a sad steadfastness, as if he were one of the monumental difficulties of life, not to be ignored. Peter was ecstasy itself.
<p>"How did you get here?" he was insisting. "How did you know I might be over here? You hadn't met Electra."
<p>Then the stranger dropped the hands he held and turned to her.
<p>"I haven't met her yet," he said, with a humorous consideration that stirred her heart. "Is this Electra?" He put out his hand, and she laid hers in the waiting palm. She felt bound to something by the magnetic grasp. The certainty was not weakened by any knowledge that other men and women felt the same.
<p>Madam Fulton came in then. She had removed the traces of past emotion, but with the red still burning in her cheeks she looked very pretty. MacLeod greeted her with an extreme deference, which presently slipped into the ordinary courtesy of man to woman as he found she had no desire to exact any special consideration. They went out to luncheon with that air of accelerated life which contributes to the success of an occasion, and then MacLeod talked. Rose sat silent, looking on with a sad indifference, as at a scene she had witnessed many times before, to no good end, and Madam Fulton listened rather satirically. But Electra and Peter glowed and could hardly eat, and MacLeod addressed himself chiefly to them. Now he did exactly what was expected of him. The brotherhood of man was his theme, and it was no mere effusion of sympathetic propaganda. His memory was his immense storehouse behind emotion, his armory. He could mobilize facts and statistics until the ordinary mind owned itself cowed by them. When they rose from the table, the millennium was imminent, and it had been brought by the sword. At the library door, Peter, beside Electra for an instant, irrepressibly seized her hand, as it hung by her side, and gave it passionate pressure. Instantly she looked at him, responsive. The sympathy they lacked in their personal relation sprang to life under MacLeod's trumpeting. Electra was in a glow, and Peter, with a surprised delight, felt all his old allegiance to his imperial lady.
<p>MacLeod would not sit down.
<p>"I must catch my train," he said.
<p>There was outcry at once from two quarters. He was not to return to the city. He was to stay here, Peter declared. It was absurd, it was unthinkable that he should do anything else. MacLeod took it with a friendly smile and the air of deprecating such undeserved cordiality; but he looked at Electra, who was frankly beseeching him from brilliant eyes. It was settled finally that he should go back to his hotel for a day or two, see some newspaper men and meet a few public engagements, and then return for a little stay.
<p>"Get your hat," he said to Rose, in affectionate suggestion, "and walk with me to the station."
<p>And as it became apparent that father and daughter had had no time for intimate talk, they were allowed to go away together, Peter following them with impetuous stammering adjurations to MacLeod to rattle through his business and come back. When they were out upon the highroad, MacLeod turned to Rose.
<p>"Well," he said, "you don't look very fit."
<p>Rose had one of her frequent impulses to tell him the crude truth: to say now, "I did until you came." But she answered indifferently, -
<p>"I'm very well."
<p>They walked along in silence for a moment, and she felt the return of old aches, old miseries he always summoned for her. In the first moment of seeing him, she always recurred to the other days when to be with him was to be in heaven. Nobody ever had so blest a time as she in the simple charm of his good-will. No matter what she was doing, for him to call her, to hold out a finger, had been enough. She would forsake the world and run, and she never remembered the world again until he loosed the spell. It was broken now, she thought, effectively, but still at these first moments her heart yearned back to the old playgrounds, the old lure.
<p>"What did she call you," he was asking - "Madam Fulton? Mrs. Tom?"
<p>"Yes," said Rose, with a quiet bitterness, "Mrs. Tom."
<p>"Have they accepted you?"
<p>She raised her eyebrows and looked at him.
<p>"You heard," she answered.
<p>"Extraordinary people! Who is Electra? I couldn't call her anything. Everybody was saying Electra."
<p>"She is Madam Fulton's granddaughter. She and Peter are engaged."
<p>"Ah! I'd forgotten that. I rather fancied it was you - with Peter."
<p>She summoned the resolution to meet him bluntly.
<p>"Don't do that, please. Don't assume anything of the sort about me."
<p>He went on with unbroken good humor. She had never seen him angry, but the possibility of it, some hidden force suspected in him, quelled her, of late, when she considered the likelihood of rousing it.
<p>"No, of course not," he said, with his habitual geniality. "Why aren't you staying with them?"
<p>She temporized, only from the general certainty that it was unsafe for him to know too much.
<p>"Peter asked me to stay there. His grandmother is very kind. I like her."
<p>"Ah! Have these people money?"
<p>"What people?"
<p>"Electra. Tom's family in general."
<p>"I don't know."
<p>"They must have. They have the air. Will they do anything for you?"
<p>Her face contracted. The look of youth had fled and left her haggard.
<p>"I have not accepted anything."
<p>"Have they offered it?"
<p>"No."
<p>"There! you see! No doubt they will."
<p>"Why did you come over here?" she cried irrepressibly.
<p>But he ignored the question.
<p>"The prince is much disturbed about you," he volunteered, throwing it into the talk as if it were of no particular validity, but only interesting as one chose to take it.
<p>"Ah! that's why you came!"
<p>"I saw him two weeks ago, in Milan. He was greatly troubled. I had to own that you had left Paris without seeing me, without even telling me your whereabouts."
<p>"Then - " said Rose.
<p>She knew what else had happened. The prince had urged, "Go over to America. Influence her. Bring her back with you." But this she did not say. The unbroken cordiality of his attitude always made his best defense. If she had ever known harshness from him, she might brave it again. But many forces between them were as yet unmeasured. She did not dare.
<p>"You must remember," he said, with the air of talking over reasonably something to which he was not even persuading her, "the prince is exceptionally placed. He could give you a certain position."
<p>"I have a certain position now. Don't forget that, will you?" She seemed to speak from an extremity of distaste.
<p>"He offers a private marriage. He is not likely to set it aside; the elder line is quite assured, so far as anything can be in this world. Besides" - he looked at her winningly - "you believe in love. He loves you."
<p>"I did believe in it," she said haltingly, as if the words were difficult. "I should find it hard now to tell what I believe."
<p>"Well!" He took off his hat to invite the summer breeze. It stirred the hair above his noble forehead, and Rose, in a sickness at old affection dead, knew, without glancing at him, how he looked, and marveled that any one so admirably made could seem to her so persistently ranged with evil forces. Yet, she reflected, it was only because he arrogated power to himself. He put his hands upon the wheels of life and jarred them.
<p>"Well! I believe in it. Isn't that enough for you?"
<p>"Not now, not now!" She had to answer, though it might provoke stern issues. "Once it would have been. There is nothing you could have told me that I would not have believed. But you delivered me over to the snare of the fowler." Grandmother had read those words in her morning chapter, and they had stayed in her ears as meaning precisely this thing. He had known that it was a snare, and he had cast her into it. She turned her moved face upon him. "We mustn't talk about these things. Nobody knows where it will end. And you mustn't talk to me about the prince."
<p>"If it doesn't mean anything to you, wouldn't it move you if I told you it meant something to me?"
<p>"What?"
<p>"It would mean a great deal if you formed an alliance there."
<p>She answered bitterly.
<p>"You are humorous. Alliance! An alliance is for princes. There are other words for these things you propose. I try not to think what they are. I dare say I don't know all of them. But there are words."
<p>"It would make me solid with the prince. He would get several concessions from his brother. They would be slight, but they would mean a great deal to the Brotherhood."
<p>"I see. You would pull a wire or two in Germany. In Russia, too, perhaps? You think you would disarm suspicion, if the prince stood by you. Maybe you'd get into Russia, even. Is that it? It would be dramatic to get into Russia after you'd been warned."
<p>She was following his mind along, as she often did, creeping with doubtful steps where he had taken wing. "But still!" She looked at him, smiling rather wistfully. "Still, you wouldn't throw me to the wolves for that, would you?"
<p>He met her look with one as candid, and little as she believed in the accompanying smile, she felt her heart warmed by it. Now he was gazing about him at the summer prospect.
<p>"I am delighted to find you here," he volunteered. "It's a change. It will do you good - do us both good."
<p>"Are you quite well?" She hesitated slightly in asking that, but he turned upon her as if the words had given him a shock of terror or dismay. In her surprise she even fancied he paled a little.
<p>"What makes you ask that?" he cried. "What do you mean by it?"
<p>"Why, I don't know! You look well, but not quite yourself, perhaps, - somehow different."
<p>MacLeod took off his hat and wiped his forehead beaded with a moisture come on it, he knew, at that moment.
<p>"I should like to ask," he said peevishly, "what in the devil you mean. Have you - heard anything?"
<p>"No," said Rose, entirely amazed. "What is there to hear?"
<p>They had reached the station, and she led him to the bench under a tree where lovers and their lasses assembled at dusk to see the train come in. She sat down, dispirited and still wondering, and he stood before her, all strength, now, and candor, as if he had thrown off his dubious mood and resolved to be himself.
<p>"About the prince," he was saying. "I want you to think of him. He would give you experiences such as I never could. You'd live on velvet. You'd have art, music, a thousand things. He likes your voice. He'd insist on fostering that. You would meet men of rank, men of note - "
<p>She interrupted him.
<p>"Men of rank! I've no doubt of it. How about their wives?"
<p>He shook his head. A look of what seemed noble pain was on his face, impatience at the shallowness of things.
<p>"Rose," he said, "you know how little I respect society as it is. Take out of it what good you can, the play of emotion, the charm, the inspiration. Don't undervalue the structure, my dear. Live, in spite of it."
<p>She looked at him wearily and thought how handsome he was, and that these were platitudes. Then his train came, and he left her with a benedictory grace, standing on the step hat in hand, majestic in his courtesy. But as she watched him, suddenly, an instant before the train was starting she saw him yield and sway. He leaned upon the rail with both hands and then, as if by a quick decision, stepped to the platform again. She hurried to him, and found him with an unfamiliar look on his face. It might have been dread anticipation; it was surely pain.
<p>"What is it?" she asked him. "Tell me."
<p>He did not answer, but involuntarily he stretched out his hand to her.
<p>"Rub it," he said. "Hold it tight. Infernal! oh, infernal!"
<p>As she rubbed the hand he suddenly recovered his old manner. The color came back to his face, and he breathed in a deep relief.
<p>"That's over," he said, almost recklessly, she thought. "Queer how quick it goes!"
<p>"What is it?" She was trembling. It seemed to her that they had each passed through some mysterious crisis.
<p>"Is there another train to town?" he was asking an official, who had kept a curious eye on him. There would be in three minutes, an accommodation crawling after the express he had lost.
<p>"Good-by again," he called to Rose, with a weaker transcript of his usual manner. "I'm to be down in a few days, you know. Good-by."
<p>This time he walked into the car, and she saw him take his seat and lie back against the window-casing. But he recovered himself and smiled, when his eyes met hers. If anything was the matter, she was evidently not to know.
<p>As the two had walked away, Peter turned to Electra, stammering forth, -
<p>"Isn't he a great old boy?"
<p>He was tremendous, she owned, in language better chosen; and this new community of feeling was restful to her.
<p>"Come out into the garden," he said, and as they went along the path to the grape arbor he took her hand and she left it to him. They seemed restored to close relations, as if MacLeod had wrought some spell upon them. By the time they reached the liquid greenness of the arbor light, Peter was sure he loved her. He could turn to her quite passionately.
<p>"Electra," he said, holding both her hands now, "I've missed you all these days."
<p>She smiled a little and that, with her glowing color, made her splendid.
<p>"You have been here every day," she said, conceding him the grace of having done his utmost.
<p>"Yes, but it hasn't been right. There's been something between us - something unexplained."
<p>She knew, so she reflected, what that was. Rose had been between them. But she listened with an attentive gravity.
<p>"We must go back to Paris," Peter was urging. "I shall work there. We will live simply and turn in everything to the Brotherhood. We must be married - dear." He looked direct and manly, not boyish, now, and she felt a sudden pride in him. "Electra, you'll go with me?"
<p>She withdrew from him and sat down, indicating the other chair.
<p>"Something very queer has happened," she said. "I must tell you about it." It had just come to her again as it had been doing at moments through the absorbing hour at luncheon, that she was in a difficult place with grandmother, and that here was the one creature whom she had the right to count upon. Rapidly she told him the facts of the case, ending with her conclusion, -
<p>"The house belongs to grandmother."
<p>Peter was frowning comically. In his effort to think, he looked as if the sun were in his eyes.
<p>"I don't believe I understand," he said, and again she told him.
<p>"You don't mean you are building all this on a casual sentence in a book?" He frowned the harder.
<p>Electra was breathing pleasure at the beauty of the case.
<p>"It is not a casual sentence," she insisted. "It's an extract from a letter."
<p>Peter had no intimate acquaintance with the business of the world, but he knew its elements. He regarded her with tenderness, as a woman attractively ignorant of harsh details.
<p>"But Electra, dear, that isn't legal. It doesn't have the slightest bearing on what you should give or what she could exact from you - if she were that kind."
<p>"No," she said, "it isn't legal. But it is - ethical." She used the large word with a sense of safety, loving the sound of it and conscious that Peter would not choke her off.
<p>"But it isn't that. You don't know how your grandfather wrote that letter. He may have done it in a fit of temper, or malice, or carelessness, or a dozen things, and forgotten it next day. A letter's the idlest thing on earth. There's no reason for your considering it a minute."
<p>"I am bound to consider it," said Electra. "There it is, in black and white. I shall make over the place to grandmother."
<p>"Well!" Peter felt like whistling, and then unpursed his lips because, according to Electra, whistling was not polite. He had no restrictions relative to her giving away her property; but he felt very seriously that she must not be allowed to indulge herself in any form of insanity, however picturesque. A detail occurred to him, and he said quickly, with a look at her, -
<p>"But Electra, you and Tom inherited this place together."
<p>She knew what was coming and her color deepened. Again Rose had stepped between them, and Electra felt herself back in their old atmosphere of constraint.
<p>"I have inherited it from Tom," she rejoined.
<p>"You ignore his wife?"
<p>Electra was silent for a long time. It was a hard struggle. But she spoke at last and in a tone which made the difficulty of speech apparent.
<p>"Since Mr. MacLeod has been here - "
<p>"Well?"
<p>"I must recognize her as his daughter."
<p>"Didn't you believe that, Electra? Not even that?"
<p>"I am forced to believe it now. When he comes back, I shall ask him to corroborate her story. If he does - I shall be obliged to - give her what is just."
<p>"Not otherwise, Electra? You believe him."
<p>"I believe him implicitly." Her tone rang out in an astonishing assurance. She might have been pledging fealty to some adored intimate.
<p>"You believe him. You would not believe me?"
<p>She hedged a little here. "You gave me no proof - only the woman's word."
<p>"Would you believe him without proof?"
<p>She was silent, yet she knew she must.
<p>"But," she said, with the haste of finishing an unwelcome subject, "I shall settle the matter as soon as possible after he comes back. If he tells me his daughter was married to my brother, she shall be paid every cent she is entitled to. But she shall not share this house - not an inch of it."
<p>"Why not?"
<p>Electra seemed to be carried on by a wave. Hurt pride found its voice, - all the revulsion she had felt in these days of Peter's divided allegiance.
<p>"The house is ours. It belongs to the family. I shall make it over to grandmother, but not to that girl. She shall never own a timber in it."
<p>Peter spoke involuntarily, with an unpremeditated wonder: -
<p>"What makes you hate her so?"
<p>Tears came slowly into Electra's eyes. They surprised her as much as they did him. She was not used to crying, and she held them from falling, with a proud restraint. Electra felt very lonely at that moment in a world which would not understand. She was upholding truth and justice, and she was accused of mean personal motives. She had proposed a picturesque sacrifice for the sake of abstract right, and she could not be unconscious that the act ought to look rather beautiful. Yet Peter saw no beauty in it, and grandmother had called her a fool. Peter, seeing the tears, was enormously embarrassed by them. He could only kiss her hand in great humility. He, on his part, put justice cheerfully aside.
<p>"How could I?" he murmured, with the contrition of the male who has learned that tears are to be stanched without delay. "How could I?" But Electra, on her feet, had drawn her hand away from him. She felt only haste, haste to conclude her abnegation, perhaps even to forestall any question of the house by getting the matter out of her hands before MacLeod came back and she had to reckon with his testimony.
<p>"I am not crying," she said proudly. "I must go and talk to grandmother. Promise me this. Don't tell her" - she hesitated.
<p>"Rose?"
<p>"Don't tell her I have spoken of this."
<p>She had gone, and Peter helplessly watched her walking up the path. Then he took his own way home. "My stars!" he muttered from time to time. His chief desire at the moment was to escape from anything so strenuous as Electra's moral life. It made a general and warm-hearted obliquity the only possible condition of conduct in a pretty world. Peter looked round at it admiringly then, as the shadow of Electra's earnestness withdrew into the distance. It was such a darling world, there were such dear shadows and beguiling lights and all things adorable to paint. He cast off the mood that teased him, and walking faster, began to whistle. It seemed to him that there were so many agreeable deeds to do, and so much time to do them in, that he must simply bestir himself to use half the richness of things. But when he got into the garden, the honeysuckle smelled so sweet that he sat down at its foot and breathed it until he went to sleep.
<p>Electra walked into the library, where Madam Fulton sat at her tatting and Billy Stark read aloud to her from an idle book. Electra felt that she could not possibly delay. All her affairs must be settled at once and the ends knit up.
<p>"I beg your pardon," she said. "Grandmother, may I speak to you a moment?"
<p>Madam Fulton laid down her work.
<p>"Is it the same old story?" she inquired.
<p>"Yes, grandmother. I don't feel that I can wait."
<p>"Electra," said the old lady kindly, "I can't listen to you. It's all fudge and nonsense. If we talk about it any more, we shall be insane together. Don't go, Billy."
<p>"I should like to put it before Mr. Stark," said Electra, with her clear gaze upon him, as if she summoned him to some exalted testimony.
<p>Billy stirred uneasily in his chair. He had confided to Florrie the night before that Electra's hypothetical cases made him as nervous as the devil. Madam Fulton cast him a comical look. It had begun to occur to her that a ball, once rolling, is difficult to stop.
<p>"Go ahead, then," she agreed. "I wash my hands of it. Billy, keep a tight grip on yourself. You'll die a-laughing."
<p>Then Electra stated her case; but Billy did not laugh. Like Peter, he looked at her frowningly, and owned he did not understand. Electra stated it again, and this time he repeated the proposition after her. Madam Fulton sat in a composed aloofness and made no comment.
<p>"But, my dear young lady," said Billy Stark, "you quite misunderstand. An extract from a letter has no legal value compared with a document signed and sealed in proper form."
<p>"I know," said Electra, "not legal, but - " She was aware that Madam Fulton's eye was upon her and she dared not finish. "It was at least my grandfather's expressed wish," she concluded firmly. "I shall carry it out."
<p>"But - " Billy sought about for a simile, "my dear child," - Electra, in the weakness of her lofty reasoning, seemed to him pathetically to be protected, - "don't you see you're putting yourself through all kinds of discomfort for nothing, simply nothing? You've gone and got a big sword - you call it justice - to cut a thread. Why, it's not even that. There's nothing, absolutely nothing there. It's very admirable of you" - Electra's waiting attitude quickened at this - "but it's fantastic."
<p>She spoke decisively.
<p>"It is the thing to do."
<p>Now Madam Fulton entered the field. She looked from one to the other, at Electra with commiseration, at Billy in a community of regret over that young intellect so dethroned.
<p>"Now you see what I told you," she warned them. "Here we are, all crazy together. We've let you say it, and we've addled our own brains listening to it for a minute. I'll tell you what, Electra!" She had discovered. "If you're so anxious to get rid of the place, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll buy it."
<p>"Buy it, grandmother? what belongs to you already?"
<p>"Don't say that again. It gives me a ringing in my ears. That's what I'll do. You're going to marry Peter Grant and go abroad. I'll take the place off your hands. I've always wanted it. I've made a shocking sum out of my book, shocking. I can well afford it. There's an offer for you!"
<p>Electra shook her head.
<p>"I couldn't," she said gently. "How could I sell you what is yours already? The letter - "
<p>"The letter!" repeated the old lady, as if it were an imprecation. She looked at Billy. He returned the glance with a despairing immobility. She reflected that the case must be worse even than she had thought, since Billy had not smiled. Electra must be madder than she had imagined, and her own culpability was the greater for weaving such a coil. "Shall I tell her, Billy?" she asked faintly.
<p>He nodded.
<p>"I should," he said commiseratingly, and got up to leave the room. It seemed to Billy this summer that he was constantly trying to escape situations with a delicacy which was more than half cowardice, only to be dragged back into the arena. The mandate he had expected promptly came.
<p>"Don't go, Billy," cried the old lady. "Sit down." Madam Fulton continued, in a hesitating humility Electra had never seen in her, "Electra, I don't believe you'll quite understand when I tell you there's something queer about the letter. You see there never was any letter. I - made it up."
<p>The boot was on the other foot. All the values of the scene had shifted. Now it was Electra who doubted the general sanity. Electra was smiling at her.
<p>"No, grandmother," she was saying, with a pretty air of chiding, "you mustn't talk that way. You think that convinces me. It's very dear of you, very dear and generous. But I know why you do it."
<p>"Bless my sinful soul!" ejaculated the old lady. "Oh - you tell her, Billy."
<p>Billy shook his head. He was not going to be dragged as far as that. He was sorry for her, but she had had her whistle and she must pay for it. The old lady was beginning again in a weak voice, -
<p>"You see, Electra, that book isn't what you think. It isn't what anybody thinks. I - I made it up."
<p>Electra was about to speak, but her grandmother forestalled her.
<p>"Don't you go and offer me wine. You get it into your head once and for all that I'm telling you a fact and that you've got to believe it. I made up my book of recollections. They're not true, not one of them. As I remember, there isn't one. The letters I wrote myself."
<p>Electra was staring at her in a neutrality which was not even wonder.
<p>Finally she spoke; her awed voice trembled.
<p>"The Brook Farm letters!"
<p>Perhaps it was this reverent hesitation which restored Madam Fulton to something of her wonted state.
<p>"For heaven's sake, Electra," she fulminated, "what is there so sacred about Brook Farm? If anybody is going to make up letters from anywhere, why shouldn't it be from there?"
<p>Electra was looking at Billy Stark as if she bade him save her from these shocks or tell her the whole world was rocking. But Billy twirled his eyeglass, and watched it twirling. Finally he had to meet her eye.
<p>"Yes," he said, with a composure he did not feel, "the book is apparently not quite straight - a kind of joke, in fact."
<p>Electra rose. She looked very thoughtful and also, Madam Fulton thought, with a quaking at her guilty heart, rather terrible. She was pinched at the nostrils and white about the lips.
<p>"What I must do first," she was saying, as if to herself, "is to notify the club we cannot possibly have our inquiry afternoon."
<p>"Notify them!" repeated Madam Fulton, in a spasm of fearful admiration. "Are you going to tell all those women?"
<p>Electra included her in that absent glance. Now that there were things to arrange, dates to cancel, topics to consider, she was on her own ground. She spoke with dignity: -
<p>"I shall most certainly tell nobody. A thing like that had better die as soon as possible. I cannot" - she turned upon her grandmother, a look of passionate interrogation on her face - "I cannot understand you."
<p>Madam Fulton answered humbly, yet with some eagerness, as if Electra might readily be excused from so stiff a task,
<p>"You never would, Electra, not if you lived a hundred years."
<p>Electra was the accuser now, age and kinship quite forgotten.
<p>"Why did you do a thing like that?"
<p>"For fun," said the old lady faintly.
<p>"For fun!" The tree of sin grew and flowered as she thought upon it. "You offered to buy this house with that money, unclean money from the sales of that fraudulent book!"
<p>Madam Fulton turned to Billy Stark with a childlike gesture of real surprise.
<p>"Is it unclean money, Billy?" she asked. "Do you call it that?"
<p>"We mustn't go too far," Billy temporized, with a warning look at Electra.
<p>She was on the way to the door. There she paused.
<p>"I do not fully understand it yet," she was saying. "It is monstrous. I dare say I never shall understand it." Then they heard her rustling up the stairs.
<p>Madam Fulton and her old friend looked at each other. When a door closed overhead, Billy's face relaxed and Madam Fulton put a hand over her lips.
<p>"Billy," said she weakly, "am I so bad?"
<p>"You're a dear, Florrie. Don't you worry."
<p>"But, Billy, is she right?"
<p>"Oh, yes, my dear, she's right."
<p>"I'm a shocking person, then!"
<p>"Yes, you're truly shocking. But you're a dear, Florrie, you're a dear."
<p>And now it was night again and Rose hurried away to the tryst. She made no doubt that she should find him there.
<p>"Playmate!" she called.
<p>"Here," answered the voice. "There's your chair. There's your throne."
<p>She plunged into the thick of the confidence intended for him.
<p>"He has come."
<p>"I know it. Peter told me."
<p>"It's all as bad as I thought. Playmate, I'm afraid I shall have to go away."
<p>"Can't you stand up to it?"
<p>"I don't know. It's pretty bad."
<p>"I guess it will have to come to your telling me about it."
<p>"Yes. You see, the worst of it is, he wants to make me love somebody I can't love."
<p>"Peter?"
<p>"No, no, not Peter. Not nice, like Peter."
<p>"Could you love Peter?"
<p>"Why should you ask me that? Peter belongs to Electra."
<p>"Not so very much. Could you love him if he asked you to?"
<p>"Oh, that's not fair, playmate!"
<p>"Yes, it is, when the night's as dark as this and it's only you and me. Could you love Peter?"
<p>"Why do you want to know?"
<p>"I want to know everything about you. Could you love Peter?"
<p>For some reason, she felt constrained to use one of her small obstinacies.
<p>"I couldn't love any man when another woman stood between us."
<p>"That's a good girl. Did you love your husband?"
<p>"My husband!" She choked upon the word. "Tom Fulton! Did you know him?"
<p>"Oh, yes, I knew him."
<p>"Was it likely I loved him?"
<p>He was considering, it seemed.
<p>"Yes," he said then, "it's very likely. Tom was a handsome devil."
<p>"But he was - a devil."
<p>"A woman wouldn't know that, not at first."
<p>"No. I didn't, at first."
<p>"Who is this other man?"
<p>"A prince."
<p>"So you would be a princess."
<p>"No, I should not be a princess." Her voice had a curious sound.
<p>"What has your father to do with it?"
<p>"Everything. The prince can advance him in certain ways. My father plays for high stakes."
<p>"Are you sure you don't want to be a princess?" The voice seemed to coax her. "Even if you do want it very much," it seemed to say, "why not relinquish it and stay here under the tree?"
<p>"No," she said, "I don't want to be a princess, even if I could be. And I don't want anything my father can offer me, or buy for me, or steal for me."
<p>"Then, playmate, when he comes back, you'll have to stand up to him or - cut."
<p>At that moment he saw before him the imagined picture of her face with the tears upon it.
<p>"It isn't easy," she was saying. "If you knew my father, you would see. You can't withstand him, he looks so kind. You can't refuse him, because he seems to want nothing but your good. You can't say you won't have a splendid time with him, because you simply have it."
<p>"Are you sure he is so bad?"
<p>"I am sure," she answered gravely. "He is very bad. And it is not because he wills to be bad. It is because he wills to have power, and as if he were better fitted to have power than almost anybody - except that he is not good. Why, do you know what power he has? He wears a ring, the seal of the Brotherhood. Whatever order is stamped with that seal is carried out, even if it is thousands of miles away. When Ivan Gorof died" - she stopped, shuddering.
<p>"What was that?"
<p>"I can't tell you. It is too dreadful. He withstood my father. And when he was found, they picked up in the chamber a bit of red wax on a shred of paper - there was nothing else - but I know and we all know it was a part of the seal that held the warrant they read to him - the assassins - before he died."
<p>"Did your father sentence him to death?"
<p>"Who else? Sometimes I get thinking about it at night, and then it seems to me as if all the people in the world had been delivered into his hand. That is because I know I have grown to be afraid of him."
<p>"Was he always cruel to you?"
<p>"Oh, never! never in the world! When I was little, I traveled about with him, and I had the best time a child ever had. I was fêted, and carried on shoulders, and made much of because I was his daughter. Then I grew up and it all - changed." Her voice fell. She remembered the snare of the fowler, but that she could not tell him.
<p>"Is he unkind to you now?"
<p>"Never! it is unbroken kindness, - a benevolence, shall I call it? But it terrifies me. For under it all is that unbending will. And I keep hardening myself against it, and yet I know the time will come when he will have his way, because he is stronger than I."
<p>"You must not let him be stronger than you. The birch bends, but it can resist."
<p>"You don't know! If he were outwardly cruel, I could defy him. But he is like the sun that nourishes and then burns. He seems to have such life in himself, such great inborn power, no one can resist it. You almost feel as if you were going against natural laws when you go against him; and you know you'll be beaten because the laws are inevitable."
<p>"That wasn't what you said of him that first night down in the shack."
<p>"No! I scoffed at him then a little. He was so far away! Now I have been near him again and I tremble."
<p>"But as you picture him, he's all good, all benevolence. You could convince a man like that."
<p>"Never! He hasn't any soul. He is this great natural force that radiates power."
<p>"Power!" echoed Osmond. "No wonder he's drunk on it. I could go down on my knees and worship it."
<p>"Not such as his!"
<p>"Such as anybody's, so long as it is power."
<p>For the first time she began to comprehend his mortal hunger.
<p>"Don't you go over to him, too," she said jealously. "Peter is under his foot. So is Electra. If you go over, I shall be alone."
<p>"I shall never go anywhere to leave you alone." Then, after a moment, he continued, "So you are not sure whether the prince loves you?"
<p>"He would call it that. It is not that to me."
<p>"Of course he loves you!"
<p>"Don't be too sure, playmate. I know the world. You know your garden."
<p>"Then why does he want you?"
<p>"It's a game. My father wants to buy him. He may want to buy my father. Then maybe he wants the prestige of owning the woman with the most beautiful hair in Europe."
<p>"Is that your hair, playmate?"
<p>"He says so."
<p>"Well, a man might do worse than gamble for a thing like that."
<p>"You amaze me." But he would not continue that, and presently she asked him, "What have you been thinking about lately?"
<p>"About you."
<p>"When?"
<p>"All day long while I was at work, and every night when I sat here and you didn't come."
<p>"Was it a happy thing to do?"
<p>"Very happy."
<p>"Even when I didn't come?"
<p>"Even when you didn't come."
<p>"Then it's just as nice to think about me as to talk to me?"
<p>"Almost!" He said it quite cheerfully, and through her pique she had to laugh.
<p>"What do you think, playmate?"
<p>"I make a world and I put you in it. Then I put myself in, too."
<p>When he spoke like this, simply and even with a gay indifference, she wondered whether the world was a pageant to him, which it cost him no pains to relinquish, and whether, too, though he had great kindliness and understanding, deep emotions were forbidden him. At least, since he was impersonal and remote, she could ask him anything.
<p>"What is your world? Is it like this?"
<p>"It isn't my world. It's yours and mine. We go about in it, having a bully time, and nobody looks at us or asks us questions."
<p>"Don't they see us?"
<p>"Oh, yes, I dare say. Only they don't stare after us and say, 'Why do they do thus and so?' They don't even speak of your beautiful hair. I talk about that myself, all the time, and you like to have me. But we should both think it mighty queer if anybody else did."
<p>"Do we speak to the other people?"
<p>"Sometimes. If we want to. If you see a diamond or a sapphire, or I see a new patent weeder, then we say, 'We want to buy that.' But we don't have much time for other folks. We travel a lot. You tell me about pictures and Alps and thrones and principalities, because I don't know much except about grafting trees and sowing seed at the best time. But always we come home here to the plantation because I find that's where I feel most at peace. And you are at peace here, too. I am delighted when I find that out."
<p>"Be delighted now, then. I am at peace here, more than anywhere else."
<p>"And when we are here, we live in our house. At first, I built a large one up there on the hill, and I had you bring over pictures for it from abroad, and I planted trees, and it was very grand. But I wasn't contented there, and you weren't, because of it. You saw at once that my shell had got to fit me, and the plain house did. So I kicked over the big house, and we lived in the old one."
<p>"With grannie?"
<p>"Yes, only I didn't think very much about her. She was always there, I suppose, like the sun through the windows, very kind and warm, and glad we were contented; but it was our house. That's what makes the charm of everything - that it's yours and mine. I couldn't sleep in the house though. It had to be outdoors."
<p>"Did I have my hammock swung in the upper veranda?"
<p>He laughed out delightedly.
<p>"How did you know? Yes, I slept down here or under the fir by the house, but you were afraid of caterpillars and you had to be up there."
<p>"I'm not afraid of anything else," she explained humbly. "Not of bears or anything in the deep woods. But caterpillars crawl so!"
<p>"However, it didn't make any difference where you were, because while we were asleep it was just as it is while we are awake - there is a fine thread that goes from me to you. There might be processions of people between us, chariots and horses and marching armies, but they couldn't break the thread."
<p>"And what do we do all day?"
<p>"Talk. Think. I think to you and you think back to me."
<p>"But we must work. If we don't, you'll get tired of me." She spoke out of sad knowledge.
<p>"Why, playmate!"
<p>The reproach in his voice recalled her, and she was ashamed to find her belief less warm than his.
<p>"Well," he conceded, "maybe we work. I go on grafting and sowing seeds and sending things to market, and you sit on a stone and sing."
<p>"Shall I sing to you now?"
<p>"No, playmate. It makes me sad."
<p>"I could sing happy songs."
<p>"That wouldn't make any difference. When you sing, it wakens something in me, some discontent, some longing bigger than I am, and that's not pleasure. It is pain."
<p>"Are you afraid of pain?"
<p>He waited a long time. Then he asked her, -
<p>"Have you ever known pain?"
<p>"Yes. I thought my mind was going."
<p>"But not pain of your body?"
<p>"Oh, no, not that."
<p>"The pain of the body is something to be afraid of. If we have it once, we cringe when we see it coming. But your singing - can I tell you what it wakens in me? No, for I don't know. Pain, the premonition of pain. Something I must escape."
<p>"Yet I was to sit by and sing to you while you were at work."
<p>"Yes, but that would be when we were quite content." It was the first wistful hint that things were lacking to him. He could not be contented; yet, against reason, his manner told a different, braver story.
<p>"You said," she began, "if armies came between us, they could not break the little thread. Suppose I go away?"
<p>"That wouldn't break it. Don't you suppose my thought can run to London or Rome? It isn't worth much if it can't."
<p>"Suppose I" - she stopped, appalled at herself for the thought, but jealously anxious to be told.
<p>"Suppose you marry the prince? That would be dreadful, because you don't love him. But it wouldn't break the thread. It would muffle it, I guess. We couldn't think back and forth on it. But it would be there."
<p>Immediately it seemed to her that she had something even more precious than she had guessed, something not to be imperiled.
<p>"I must not do anything to muffle it," she said. "Either with the prince - or any one."
<p>"The only thing I'm afraid of," he went on, "is that you won't stand up to your father. Why, you must, playmate, if you feel like that about him."
<p>She answered bitterly.
<p>"I am afraid, I suppose."
<p>Osmond spoke out sharply in the tone of a man who dismisses dreams.
<p>"Don't be afraid. Stand up and fight."
<p>Her pathetic voice recalled him.
<p>"But think! You said you were afraid of pain. You ought to know what fear is."
<p>He answered slowly, and in what seemed almost exaltation, -
<p>"I am afraid of pain; but when the time comes I shan't wait for it. I shall go out to meet it."
<p>"What do you mean?"
<p>He seemed another creature, all steel and fire, not an impersonal thing speaking out of the dark.
<p>"Don't you know we all want something big, something bigger than we are to fight and conquer? Before we leave this earth, we want to make our mark on it, that shall not be washed away."
<p>"Are you ambitious?"
<p>"I don't know. I do know I mean to live - when I am free."
<p>Alarm was quickening in her. He seemed to be withdrawing into dark halls where she could not see to follow. He was building the house of his heart, yet there were apparently other edifices, fortresses or dungeons, it might be, where he walked alone.
<p>"When you are free?" she insisted.
<p>"When Pete has got his gait and I needn't back him. When grannie is dead - dear grannie! Then I shall do my one free act."
<p>She was so shaken that it seemed as if the night itself terrified her, not he alone.
<p>"Not" - she paused, and then whispered it. "Do you mean - to kill yourself?"
<p>He laughed.
<p>"Not on your life! I am going to get all that's coming to me. But I am going to get it in my own particular way."
<p>"I cannot understand you."
<p>"Of course you can't. But remember all of you have something to bring to life. You give as well as take. You have your beauty and your voice. Peter has his brush. Grannie has her mothering gift. That's better than being a queen. There's power in it. Your prince has his inheritance. I have had to look about and choose my gift. I chose it long ago."
<p>"Is it something that makes you happy?"
<p>"It made me wild when I discovered it, because I saw it was mine. Nothing had ever been mine before. As it comes nearer and nearer, it looks pretty grim to me. But it's mine, still. When men used to go out to fight, they must have said a good many times, 'This is a nasty situation, but it's my quarrel.' And this is mine."
<p>She felt her loneliness. At once it seemed that she had not yet known the real man. Their play at friendship, sympathy, - what was it? - had been only play. Like all men, he could bring the woman a flower, a crown even, "a rosy wreath," but the roses must wither while he chose his sword. She could not speak.
<p>"What is it, playmate?" he asked presently. It was the old kindly voice.
<p>"I must go back. I'm cold."
<p>"Cold! It's warm to-night."
<p>"Good-night."
<p>He followed her.
<p>"I did it. I chilled you somehow. Forgive me."
<p>She could not speak, and he was at her side.
<p>"I know. There are things that can't be talked about. They sound like twaddle. These things I've told you - they're well enough to think about. They can't be said. You're disappointed in me!"
<p>But it was not that he had told her too much; he had told her too little. He had put her away from him.
<p>"Good-night," she said again. "It's all right, playmate, truly."
<p>His anxious voice came after her.
<p>"It's not all right. I've muddled it."
<p>Electra felt very much alone in a world of wrongdoers. To her mind moral trespassing was a definite state of action fully recognized by the persons concerned in it. She made no doubt that everybody was as well able to classify obliquity as she was to do it for them. She had stated times for sitting down and debating upon her own past deeds, though she seldom found any flagrant fault in them. There was now and then an inability to reach her highest standard; but she saw no crude derelictions such as other people fell into. It was almost impossible for her to think about grandmother at all, the old lady seemed to her so naughty and so mad. Billy Stark, too, though he was a man of the world, admirably equipped, was guilty of extreme bad taste or he could never have asked Madam Fulton to marry him. Why was he calling her Florrie and giving her foolish nosegays every morning? Rose and Peter, when it came to them, seemed pledged to keeping up some wild fiction beneficial to Rose; only Markham MacLeod was entirely right, and so powerful, too, that his return must shake all the warring atoms into a harmonious conformity with Electra and the moral law.
<p>Moreover, she had the entire programme of the club meeting to reconstruct. Nothing, she inexorably knew, would tempt her to allow for a moment any further consideration of her grandmother's pernicious book. Yet the club was to meet with her, the honorable secretary, and it had no topic to whet its teeth upon. In her dilemma, she put on her hat and walked over to inquire of Rose when her father was to return. MacLeod's bubbling kindliness seemed to her so generous that she made no doubt he would talk to them for an hour, or even allow her to give him a reception.
<p>Rose was in the garden, as usual, in the long chair, and Peter was painting. Ostensibly he was painting her, but the mood escaped him and he was blurring in a background. Electra remembered, as she went up the path, that still nothing had been said to her about Peter's painting. He might have been any sort of young 'prentice for all she heard about his work; and here it was beginning incidentally, like an idle task, with no reference to her. She had thought painting was something to be carried on gravely, when one had reached Peter's eminence. There ought to be talk of theories and emotions inspired by pictures in the inception, not merely this prosaic business of sitting down to work and characterizing beauties with a flippant jargon of words misused. "Very nice," "stunning" - that was what she had heard Peter say even of sunsets that ought to have moved him to the skies. He had a delicate-fingered way of touching everything, as if the creative process were a little one, of small simplicities: not as if art were long.
<p>When she appeared that morning, behind the hollyhocks, Rose was about to spring up, and Peter did stand, expectant, with his charming smile. Electra at once made proper disclaimers, and insisted that the sitter's pose should not be broken and that it would be an immense entertainment to see the work go on. Peter brought a chair out of the arbor, and she sat down, erect and handsome, while Rose sank back into her unconstrained reclining. Rose wore the simplest dress, and her slender arms were bare. There were about her the signs of tasks abandoned, even of pleasures dropped and not remembered - the book half closed upon her finger, the rose and fan. Her great hat with its long feather lay beside her on the ground, and Electra, justly appraising its picturesqueness and value, thought, with brief distaste, that it looked as if it might belong to an actress. She asked her question at once and Rose answered. No, her father would not be here in time for the important meeting. She had no doubt he would indeed have said more than a few words, since the entertainment had fallen through. Here Electra interrupted her delicately and challenged the use of that term for so serious an issue. It could hardly be called an entertainment; they had simply been unable to consider the topic fixed upon, and it was necessary to find a substitute.
<p>"Let me do something," said Rose, with her appealing grace. "I'll sing for them."
<p>That accounted for her again, Electra thought, the unconsidered ease, perhaps the boldness. She belonged to public life; yet as such she might well be taken into account.
<p>"What do you sing?" she asked.
<p>Rose forgot all about her picture and sat up, looking quite in earnest. Peter held his brush reproachfully poised.
<p>"I tell you what I can do," she said, after a moment's thinking. "I can give a little talk on contemporary music - what they are doing in France, in Germany. I can give some personal data about living musicians - things they wouldn't mind. And I really sing very well. Peter, boy, tell the lady I sing well."
<p>"She sings adorably," said Peter. "She has a nightingale in her throat: -
<p>"You never heard anything more sympathetic. I never did."
<p>The "Peter, boy," had spoiled it. Electra grew colder. She wished she were able to be as easy as she liked; but she never could be, with other people perpetually doing and saying things in such bad taste.
<p>"The club is composed of ladies who know the best music," she heard herself saying, and realized that it sounded like a child's copy-book.
<p>Rose was still sitting upright, Peter patiently looking at her, evidently wishing she would return to her pose, and yet quite as evidently enriching his attention with this new aspect of her. She had turned into a vivid and yet humble creature, intent on offering something and having it accepted. The thought that she had something Electra wanted seemed for the moment the next best thing to knowing that Electra tendered her kinship and recognition.
<p>"Please like me," her look begged for her. "Please tolerate me, at least, and take what I have to give."
