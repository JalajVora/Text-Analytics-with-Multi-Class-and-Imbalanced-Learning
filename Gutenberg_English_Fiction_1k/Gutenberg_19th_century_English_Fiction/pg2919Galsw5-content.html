<p>Afternoon, on the departure platform of an Austrian railway station. At several little tables outside the buffet persons are taking refreshment, served by a pale young waiter. On a seat against the wall of the buffet a woman of lowly station is sitting beside two large bundles, on one of which she has placed her baby, swathed in a black shawl.
<p>WAITER. Yes, sare.
<p>WAITER. 'Komm' gleich'!
<p>AMERICAN. My eggs! Get a wiggle on you!
<p>ENGLISHWOMAN. Bother!
<p>GERMAN. 'Kellner, bezahlen'!
<p>WAITER. 'Eine Krone sechzig'.
<p>LITTLE MAN. Herr Ober!
<p>Might I have a glass of beer?
<p>WAITER. Yes, sare.
<p>LITTLE MAN. Thank you very much.
<p>LITTLE MAN. Yes, yes.
<p>AMERICAN. I smile.
<p>LITTLE MAN. Oughtn't I to call him that?
<p>AMERICAN. Why, yes! Just "waiter."
<p>LITTLE MAN. I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
<p>GERMAN. Gott!
<p>AMERICAN. In my country we're very democratic - but that's quite a proposition.
<p>ENGLISHWOMAN. No, thanks.
<p>Waiter! Flash of beer - jump, now!
<p>WAITER. 'Komm' gleich'!
<p>GERMAN. 'Cigarren'!
<p>WAITER. 'Schon'!
<p>AMERICAN. That is a very luminous answer.
<p>GERMAN. Tolstoi is nothing. Man should himself express. He must push - he must be strong.
<p>AMERICAN. That is so. In America we believe in virility; we like a man to expand. But we believe in brotherhood too. We draw the line at niggers; but we aspire. Social barriers and distinctions we've not much use for.
<p>ENGLISHMAN. Do you feel a draught?
<p>GERMAN. Wait! You are a young people.
<p>AMERICAN. For example - is it your opinion that we should kill off the weak and diseased, and all that can't jump around?
<p>GERMAN. 'Nein, nein'! That is stupid.
<p>GERMAN. Cigarren!
<p>WAITER. 'Komm' gleich'!
<p>ENGLISHWOMAN. Really! Nuisance!
<p>GERMAN. Ah! ha! you will bresently find there is nothing in him but self.
<p>AMERICAN. Very stimulating question.
<p>GERMAN. In human nature I believe so far as I can see him - no more.
<p>AMERICAN. Now that 'pears to me kind o' blasphemy. I believe in heroism. I opine there's not one of us settin' around here that's not a hero - give him the occasion.
<p>LITTLE MAN. Oh! Do you believe that?
<p>AMERICAN. Well! I judge a hero is just a person that'll help another at the expense of himself. Take that poor woman there. Well, now, she's a heroine, I guess. She would die for her baby any old time.
<p>GERMAN. Animals will die for their babies. That is nothing.
<p>ENGLISHWOMAN. I beg your pardon.
<p>LITTLE MAN. I'm afraid I'm nothing particular. My father was half-English and half-American, and my mother half-German and half-Dutch.
<p>WAITER. 'Komm' gleich'!
<p>AMERICAN. You seem kind of skeery about that. You've had experience, maybe. I'm an optimist - I think we're bound to make the devil hum in the near future. I opine we shall occasion a good deal of trouble to that old party. There's about to be a holocaust of selfish interests. The colonel there with old-man Nietch he won't know himself. There's going to be a very sacred opportunity.
<p>ENGLISHMAN. What does he say?
<p>GERMAN. Our drain has come in, de oder platform; only one minute we haf.
<p>AMERICAN. Now, that's very provoking. I won't get that flash of beer.
<p>AMERICAN. What's that? Help?
<p>LITTLE MAN. Come along, good woman, come along!
<p>A second-class compartment of a corridor carriage, in motion. In it are seated the ENGLISHMAN and his WIFE, opposite each other at the corridor end, she with her face to the engine, he with his back. Both are somewhat protected from the rest of the travellers by newspapers. Next to her sits the GERMAN, and opposite him sits the AMERICAN; next the AMERICAN in one window corner is seated the DUTCH YOUTH; the other window corner is taken by the GERMAN'S bag. The silence is only broken by the slight rushing noise of the train's progression and the crackling of the English newspapers.
<p>AMERICAN. The Germans are great readers. Very stimulating practice. I read most anything myself!
<p>"Don Quixote" - fine book. We Americans take considerable stock in old man Quixote. Bit of a wild-cat - but we don't laugh at him.
<p>GERMAN. He is dead. Dead as a sheep. A good thing, too.
<p>AMERICAN. In America we have still quite an amount of chivalry.
<p>GERMAN. Chivalry is nothing 'sentimentalisch'. In modern days - no good. A man must push, he must pull.
<p>AMERICAN. So you say. But I judge your form of chivalry is sacrifice to the state. We allow more freedom to the individual soul. Where there's something little and weak, we feel it kind of noble to give up to it. That way we feel elevated.
<p>GERMAN. 'Ach'! So!
<p>AMERICAN. Dear me!
<p>LITTLE MAN. Is there room? I can't find a seat.
<p>AMERICAN. Why, yes! There's a seat for one.
<p>AMERICAN. Come right in!
<p>AMERICAN. Where's the mother?
<p>AMERICAN. My! That would appear to be quite a domestic incident.
<p>AMERICAN. Maybe you'd better get off right smart and restore that baby. There's nothing can act madder than a mother.
<p>LITTLE MAN. Poor thing, yes! What she must be suffering!
<p>LITTLE MAN. We got there just as the train was going to start; and I jumped, thinking I could help her up. But it moved too quickly, and - and left her.
<p>AMERICAN. Guess I'd have thrown the baby out to her.
<p>LITTLE MAN. I was afraid the poor little thing might break.
<p>LITTLE MAN. Afraid I've hardly looked at it yet.
<p>AMERICAN. Which end up is it?
<p>LITTLE MAM. Oh! I think the right end. Yes, yes, it is.
<p>AMERICAN. Well, that's something. Maybe you should hold it out of window a bit. Very excitable things, babies!
<p>AMERICAN. You are right, ma'am. I opine there's a draught out there. This baby is precious. We've all of us got stock in this baby in a manner of speaking. This is a little bit of universal brotherhood. Is it a woman baby?
<p>LITTLE MAN. I - I can only see the top of its head.
<p>AMERICAN. You can't always tell from that. It looks kind of over-wrapped up. Maybe it had better be unbound.
<p>GERMAN. 'Nein, nein, nein'!
<p>AMERICAN. I think you are very likely right, colonel. It might be a pity to unbind that baby. I guess the lady should be consulted in this matter.
<p>ENGLISHWOMAN. Yes, yes, of course - - !
<p>AMERICAN. That would seem only known to Providence at this moment. I judge it might be due to humanity to look at its face.
<p>AMERICAN. I would surmise in your leisure moments you have created babies, sir?
<p>LITTLE MAN. Oh! no - indeed, no.
<p>AMERICAN. What sort of a physiognomy has it, anyway?
<p>GERMAN. Oh! Ha! Pfui!
<p>AMERICAN. I am told that is not uncommon amongst babies. Perhaps we could have you inform us, ma'am.
<p>ENGLISHWOMAN. Yes, of course - only what sort of - -
<p>AMERICAN. That will be rather difficult to come at. I'm just a bit sensitive. I've very little use for affections of the epidermis.
<p>AMERICAN. Is it kind of boiled looking?
<p>LITTLE MAN. Yes - yes, it is.
<p>ENGLISHWOMAN. Poor little thing! Shall I - - ?
<p>AMERICAN. I honour your emotion, ma'am. It does credit to us all. But I sympathize with your husband too. The measles is a very important pestilence in connection with a grown woman.
<p>LITTLE MAN. It likes my finger awfully. Really, it's rather a sweet baby.
<p>LITTLE MAN. No-o; they're dark, almost black.
<p>AMERICAN. Typhus! That's quite an indisposition!
<p>ENGLISHMAN. Bit stuffy for you here, dear, isn't it?
<p>Guess I'm wanted in the dining-car.
<p>An arrival platform. The LITTLE MAN, with the BABY and the bundle, is standing disconsolate, while travellers pass and luggage is being carried by. A STATION OFFICIAL, accompanied by a POLICEMAN, appears from a doorway, behind him.
<p>OFFICIAL. 'Sie haben einen Buben gestohlen'?
<p>LITTLE MAN. I only speak English and American.
<p>OFFICIAL. 'Dies ist nicht Ihr Bube'?
<p>Ill - the baby - -
<p>LITTLE MAN. Why? I don't want the poor baby.
<p>LITTLE Mary. No.
<p>OFFICIAL. Gut! You are 'rested.
<p>LITTLE MAN. I only took it for the poor woman. I'm not a thief - I'm - I'm - -
<p>OFFICIAL. Halt still! You are 'rested. It is all right.
<p>LITTLE MAN. Where is the mother?
<p>OFFICIAL. She comet by next drain. Das telegram say: 'Halt einen Herren mit schwarzem Buben and schwarzem Gepack'. 'Rest gentleman mit black baby and black - pag.
<p>OFFICIAL. 'Komm mit us'.
<p>AMERICAN. Guess you've got an angel from heaven there! What's the gentleman in buttons for?
<p>OFFICIAL. 'Was ist das'?
<p>AMERICAN. Is there anybody here that can understand American?
<p>OFFICIAL. 'Verstehe nicht'.
<p>AMERICAN. But I'm telling you. This is a white man. This is probably the whitest man on Gawd's earth.
<p>AMERICAN. Oh! Very well, arrest him; do your duty. This baby has typhus.
<p>OFFICIAL. Typhus? Der Bub - die baby hat typhus?
<p>AMERICAN. I'm telling you.
<p>OFFICIAL. Gott im Himmel!
<p>AMERICAN. I kind o' thought you'd feel like that.
<p>OFFICIAL. 'Die Sanitatsmachine! Gleich'!
<p>AMERICAN. Guess you'd better isolate the baby.
<p>OFFICIAL. You must.
<p>GERMAN. His spirit ever denies.
<p>'Sag' Ihm': Instantly put down baby, and komm' mit us.
<p>LITTLE MAN. Leave the poor ill baby here alone? Be - be - be d - -d to you!
<p>AMERICAN. What does that body-snatcher say?
<p>GERMAN. He say this man use the baby to save himself from arrest. Very smart he say.
<p>Do you 'ear?
<p>OFFICIAL. Put ze baby down, or ich will goummand someone it to do.
<p>AMERICAN. That will be very interesting to watch.
<p>GERMAN. He say he is not his officier.
<p>AMERICAN. That just tickles me to death.
<p>AMERICAN. My! That's wonderful. What a man this is! What a sublime sense of duty!
<p>MOTHER. 'Ach! Ach! Mei' Bubi'!
<p>GERMAN. He say: Why did you a baby with typhus with you bring out?
<p>AMERICAN. Well, that's quite a question.
<p>OFFICIAL. Er hat Typhus.
<p>AMERICAN. Now, that's where you slop over. Come right here.
<p>OFFICIAL. Lass die Frau!
<p>MOTHER. Mei' Bubi!
<p>AMERICAN. What's that? They goin' to pitch him after all?
