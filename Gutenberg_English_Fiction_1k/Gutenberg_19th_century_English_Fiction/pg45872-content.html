<p>or, Wedded to Her Choice

<p>Paper and printing equal to any 25 cent series on the market. Handsome and Attractive Cover of different design for each issue.
<p>She stood behind the counter in H. O'Neill's splendid dry-goods emporium on Sixth avenue - only one of his army of salesgirls, yet not a belle of the famous society Four Hundred could eclipse her in beauty - pretty Geraldine, with her great, starry, brown eyes lighting up a bewitching face, with a skin like a rose-leaf, and a low, white brow, crowned by an aureole of curly hair, in whose waves the sunshine was tangled so that it could not get free. Her round, white throat rose proudly from a simple, nun-like gown of fine black serge, unadorned save by the beauty of the form it fitted with easy grace.
<p>She would have graced a queen's drawing-room, this lovely girl with her starry eyes and demure dimples, but untoward fate had placed her behind a glove counter in New York.
<p>It was very cold up to ten o'clock that bright October morning, and the great throngs of fall shoppers were not yet out in force, so Geraldine had an idle moment in which to gossip with her chum, plump, gray-eyed Cissy Carroll.
<p>They both belonged to an amateur dramatic society, and a generous manager had sent them tickets for the play that evening. It was of this anticipated pleasure that they were chatting joyously, when a low, deep, masculine voice spoke to Geraldine across the counter:
<p>"Gloves, please."
<p>She turned quickly toward her customer, and at the same moment a very exacting lady claimed Cissy's attention.
<p>The shop was rapidly filling with elegantly dressed women of fashion, and they would have no more leisure that day.
<p>Geraldine saw before her an elegant-looking gentleman - tall, broad-shouldered, graceful, with a clean-shaven face, clear-cut features, fair, clustering locks, and large, glittering, light-blue eyes, keen and clear as points of steel in their direct gaze, but with something unpleasant somehow in their admiring expression that made the pretty salesgirl drop her eyes bashfully, as he continued, easily:
<p>"I have lost a bet of a box of gloves to a lady, and would like you to assist me in selecting some pretty ones to pay the debt."
<p>"What size?" she asked, as she began pulling down the boxes.
<p>"Sixes," he replied, and added: "She is a gay and pretty young girl - an actress."
<p>"An actress!" Geraldine sighed, enviously, then smothered the sigh by saying, carelessly: "We both wear the same size of glove."
<p>"Ah!" and the customer gazed admiringly at the slender, dimpled white hands sorting out the gloves, then continued: "And I am an actor, and it pleases me to tell you that I am Clifford Standish, the leading man in 'Hearts and Homes,' the society play you are going to see to-night."
<p>He laid his elegantly engraved card before her, and she started with surprise and pleasure, faltering, eagerly:
<p>"I - I am proud to know you - but how did you guess I was going to the theatre to-night?"
<p>"I beg your pardon for listening, but I heard you and your chum talking about it while I stood at the counter waiting for you to notice me."
<p>"Oh, did I keep you waiting? I am very sorry; and if the floor-walker had observed my inattention, I should have been scolded."
<p>Clifford Standish drank in with keen delight the music of her voice, and thrilled with rapture at her rare beauty, so he answered, gallantly:
<p>"He did not see you, and I was in no hurry, for it pleased me just to stand there and watch you. I was watching your spirited face and gestures and thinking that you would make a clever actress. You belong to an amateur dramatic society, do you not?"
<p>"Oh, yes, and I enjoy it so much. It is the dream of my life to be an actress!" exclaimed Geraldine, impulsively, her eager, brown eyes shining like stars. Her beauty thrilled his blood like a draught of rare old wine, and he felt that here was the love of his life, for no woman had ever touched his heart as maddeningly as this one; so he answered, almost as passionately, in a swift, overmastering impulse to draw her within the circle of his life:
<p>"A dream that may easily become a reality. Will you let me help you to become an actress? I am almost sure that I can secure you a position in my company."
<p>"Oh, I would be so grateful," smiled Geraldine, her cheeks glowing crimson with joy.
<p>"Then you will permit me to call on you and talk it over? Let me see - you will be at home this evening at seven o'clock, will you not? May I come for half an hour at that time?"
<p>"If you please," she answered, eagerly, scribbling her address on the back of his card.
<p>He took it with thanks, his keen, blue eyes gleaming with triumph at the success of his ruse, and then gave his attention to the gloves, which he paid for and directed to be sent to his hotel.
<p>He lingered as long as he dared after the purchase, but another customer soon claimed Geraldine's attention, so he smiled and bowed himself away, leaving the young girl with a fluttering heart and blushing cheeks, the result of this chance, but fateful, meeting.
<p>Geraldine and Cecilia were close friends, having come together from their country homes to seek employment among strangers in the great city. They roomed together in the third story of a cheap apartment-house, and Cissy, as her intimates called her, was like an older sister to the ambitious Geraldine.
<p>Cissy was twenty-five, and her friend only eighteen, so she always assumed the role of adviser to her junior, and as they walked home from the store that evening, she said, reprovingly:
<p>"My dear, I didn't like the young man who talked to you so glibly over the gloves this morning."
<p>"Ah, Cissy, you don't know who that young man was, or you would be proud of his notice!" And Geraldine poured out a breathless account of her good fortune.
<p>But, to her surprise, Cecilia answered, gravely:
<p>"Oh, I heard a good deal that he was saying to you, and noticed, too, that he looked at you as if he would like to eat you up. But, dear Geraldine, please don't let him persuade you with his silly flatteries to go on the stage. It's a hard life for a young girl, they say, and full of terrible temptations. Believe me, you are better off behind O'Neill's glove counter."
<p>Geraldine's pride was cruelly wounded at Cissy's lack of sympathy in her pet ambition, and she answered, rashly:
<p>"Cissy Carroll, you're just jealous, that's why you preach to me! I can't help being pretty and attractive, can I? And I know that if he had offered to make you an actress, instead of me, you'd have sung quite another tune."
<p>Cecilia felt her friend's slur on her own attractiveness, and flushed with quick resentment.
<p>She knew that she was not as beautiful as Geraldine, but she had the soft, plump prettiness of a gray dove, so attractive to many men, and she had not lacked for admirers, although, for reasons of her own, she was single still, so she tossed her pretty dark head, her gray eyes flashing scorn, and made no reply to the ungenerous attack.
<p>Geraldine, still angry, continued, patronizingly:
<p>"If you would like to be an actress, too, Cissy, I'll introduce the actor to you when he calls this evening, and ask him to get you a position."
<p>"Pray, don't trouble yourself, for I sha'n't enter the room while he's there. I despise real stage people! They're most always shabby sheep, and their acquaintance no credit," returned Cissy, rudely, giving such mortal offense by the taunt that Geraldine did not speak another word to her on the way home.
<p>They had two small rooms, and Cissy hastened to one to prepare their simple tea, so as to get ready for the theatre, but Geraldine hurried to beautify herself for her caller, putting on her best gown, a garnet cashmere, with velvet trimmings, and drawing her wealth of golden brown locks into the classic Psyche knot.
<p>"Supper's ready!" called Cissy, curtly, from the next room.
<p>"I don't want any, thank you," Geraldine answered, coldly, and, indeed, her excitement ran too high for her to eat.
<p>So Cissy ate her solitary meal in snubbed silence, while the radiant Geraldine entertained her caller, for Clifford Standish soon came, and spent a delightful half-hour, having to tear himself away at the last minute to return to his stage duties. Then she and Cissy patched up a kind of truce, and went together to the play, returning at the close, Cissy silent and disapproving, and Geraldine more determined than ever to go on the stage.
<p>The girls were very distant to each other after that, but Geraldine carried a high head, and clung to her purpose, encouraged by the handsome young actor, who called on her for a short while every evening, and gave her tickets to every performance, declaring that she inspired him to his best work by the rapt gaze of her appreciative eyes as she sat in the audience.
<p>But Cissy would not accompany her friend again to the play, doing all she could in a quiet way to wean her from her infatuation, but in vain.
<p>She thought that Geraldine was weak and vain and silly, and the latter believed that Cissy was jealous of her good fortune. She hoped that she would soon be able to go on the stage, and part from the girl who had grown so selfish and cruel. The breach widened between their once loving hearts, and neither tried to bridge it over by a kind, forgiving word.
<p>Toward the end of the week, Geraldine said, coldly:
<p>"I am not going to work to-morrow morning, Cissy. I asked for a day's holiday before I left the store yesterday."
<p>"Why?" asked Cissy, curiously.
<p>"Mr. Standish has invited me to go with him on an excursion to Newburgh to witness the firemen's parade there. The firemen are having a grand celebration, you know, with splendid music, a grand parade, and all sorts of firemen's games. I wish you were going, too, Cissy!" wistfully.
<p>"Well, I don't, and I think you are imprudent to go alone with that strange actor - so there!"
<p>"Well, come with us, Cissy, won't you? I don't think he would mind your going!"
<p>"Oh, yes, he would! 'Two are company, three a crowd!'" Cissy quoted, flippantly, and she went alone to work the next morning, Geraldine having started at an earlier hour to take the day boat for Newburgh.
<p>"How lovely she is, this brown-eyed little beauty! My heart is really touched at last, and I would give the world to call her mine!" thought Clifford Standish, as he led Geraldine on the crowded boat and watched her sweet face glow with pleasure at the animated scene.
<p>He said to her, in apparent jest, but secret earnest:
<p>"There are some members of the crack company of the New York Fire Department on board this morning, going to Newburgh, to take part in the parade and games to-day. They are fine-looking fellows, in their bright, new uniforms, but I hope you won't lose your heart to any of them. I think fate has destined you for an actor's bride."
<p>His ardent, meaning glance made the blood flow in a torrent to her cheeks, but she was saved the necessity of replying, for at that moment she saw a woman's handkerchief waved to him from the shore, and he exclaimed, in an embarrassed tone:
<p>"I see a friend beckoning me. Will you excuse me for a moment?"
<p>He ran hastily down the gang-plank, leaving Geraldine alone on the crowded deck among the good-natured throng of people in the nipping air of the early morning, for the sunshine had not yet pierced the fog that lightly overhung the beautiful Hudson.
<p>But Geraldine did not mind the frosty air, for her dark-blue suit was both warm and becoming, and the merry crowd and the martial music played by the band inspired her to cheerful thoughts.
<p>She passed the minutes so pleasantly in watching the animated faces about her that she did not realize how long Mr. Standish was absent, until suddenly the whistle blew, the gang-plank was drawn up, and the steamer moved away from shore, thrilling the girl with swift alarm over her escort's absence.
<p>She looked about her with a keen, searching gaze, then back to the shore.
<p>A crowd of people were leaving the wharf, but among none of them could she distinguish the stately form of Mr. Standish.
<p>"What had become of her escort?" she asked herself, in terror, wondering if he had willfully deserted her like this.
<p>A choking sob rose up in her pretty throat, and her eyes filled with frightened tears.
<p>She thought, miserably:
<p>"Oh, I wish I hadn't come! I wish I had listened to Cissy's warnings! Why did Mr. Standish treat me like this? He is a mean wretch, and I'll never, never speak to him again!"
<p>Poor little Geraldine, so lovely and so impulsive, if she had kept to that resolution, this story would never have been written. Her life would have flowed on too quietly and happily to have tempted a novelist's pen.
<p>But "fate is above us all."
<p>She looked about her despairingly for a friendly face among all those strangers.
<p>Her tearful eyes encountered the gaze of a fireman who had been covertly watching her ever since she came on board.
<p>He was a magnificent specimen of athletic young manhood, his fine straight figure setting off to advantage his resplendent uniform of dark-blue, with fawn-colored facings and gilt buttons. His face was bold, handsome, and winning, with a straight nose, laughing dark-blue eyes, a dark, curling mustache, while beneath his blue cap clustered beautiful blue-black curls, fine and glossy as a woman's hair.
<p>When Geraldine's appealing eyes met the admiring gaze of this young man it paused and lingered as if held by some irresistible attraction, and, advancing to her, he lifted his blue cap courteously from his handsome head, saying, kindly:
<p>"You seem to be in trouble, miss. Can I help you?"
<p>Thus encouraged by his kind look and tone, the girl faltered out her distressing plight:
<p>"My escort went back on shore to speak to a friend, and was left behind. And I - I - don't know anybody - and have no ticket - and no money with me!"
<p>Poor, troubled baby! How charming she was with those crimson cheeks and wet eyes, and that tremulous quiver in her low voice! The handsome fireman's heart went out to her so strongly that he longed to take her in his arms like a child, and kiss away her pearly tears.
<p>But of course, he didn't obey that strong impulse. He only said, cordially:
<p>"Don't let that little trifle worry you, miss. You must permit me to buy you a ticket, and to take care of you to-day, like a brother. Will you?"
<p>How glad Geraldine was to find such a kind friend. Her heart began to rebound from its depression, and she exclaimed, gratefully:
<p>"Oh, how can I thank you enough? I felt so frightened, so like a lost child, till you spoke to me! Yes, I shall be very grateful if you will buy me a ticket. I'll pay you when we get back to New York. And - and - till then, please keep this!"
<p>She held out to him her sole ornament, a pretty little ring, and insisted, against all his entreaties, that he should hold it in pawn for her debt.
<p>"You oughtn't to trust your engagement-ring to another fellow," he said, lightly, as he slipped it over his little finger.
<p>Geraldine blushed brightly as she answered to this daring challenge:
<p>"Oh, it's not my engagement-ring at all. I'm not engaged."
<p>"I'm very glad to hear it," he replied, meaningly, then proffered her his card, on which she read, in a clear, bold chirography, the name: "Harry Hawthorne."
<p>Geraldine bowed, and said:
<p>"I haven't a card, but my name is Miss Harding - Geraldine Harding. I would like your address, please, so that I may return your money to-morrow."
<p>"I am usually at the engine-house on Ludlow street - Engine Company No. 17. Driver, you see; and our splendid horses - oh, but you ought to see how they love me," enthusiastically; then pulling himself up with a jerk; "but, pray don't trouble to return the money. It will be better for me to call, will it not, and return your ring?"
<p>She assented, and gave him her address; then he found her a seat, and as their boat plowed swiftly through the frothing waves, they fell into a pleasant chat, during which he said, courteously:
<p>"I saw you come on board with Standish, the actor. Are you a member of his company?"
<p>"Not yet; but I hope to be one soon. I'm only a salesgirl at O'Neill's now, but Mr. Standish has promised to help me to become an actress."
<p>She read distinct disapproval in his dark-blue eyes as he said:
<p>"But you will have to study a long while before you can make your debut."
<p>"No, for I've already studied a great deal, and acted several parts in the amateur dramatic company to which I belong. Mr. Standish says I can go right on as soon as I secure a position."
<p>"Perhaps you will regret it if you go on the stage," he observed, abruptly.
<p>"Oh, no; for it is the dream of my life!" smiled Geraldine.
<p>"Will your friends permit it?"
<p>"I'm only an orphan girl, earning her own living, so I don't need to ask any one's leave. And I'm glad of that, for I'm ambitious, and want to rise in life. I'm tired of being the slave of the public at a dry-goods counter," cried Geraldine, with sparkling eyes.
<p>He gazed at her admiringly, but he did not hesitate to say:
<p>"It is only an exchange of slavery from the counter to the stage. You will be the slave of the public still. If you would listen to me, I would persuade you to remain where you are - until some good man marries you, and makes you the queen of his heart and home."
<p>Geraldine tossed her shining head, and gave him a saucy smile, and retorted:
<p>"That sounds like my chum's preaching, but I shall not listen to either of you. My heart is set on a stage career."
<p>Harry Hawthorne gave her a grave look, but made no reply in words, and for a few moments they kept silence, while the gay, lilting music of the band filled up the pauses, and the sun pierced through the fog and smiled on the majestic steamer plowing her way through the blue, sparkling waves.
<p>Geraldine felt intuitively that he disapproved of her plans, and maintained a pouting silence until he remarked, genially:
<p>"I have an idea!"
<p>She looked at him, questioningly, and he continued:
<p>"The wife of our captain is on board to-day, going to Newburgh. Now, wouldn't it be pleasant to introduce you, so that she could look after you while I'm taking part in the firemen's games?"
<p>Geraldine felt as if he were tired of her already, and eager to put her in charge of some one else, and her heart sank with a strange pain, but she did not permit him to see her mortification, she only gave an eager, smiling assent.
<p>"I should like it very much, if the lady will be so kind."
<p>"Then I will go and bring Mrs. Stansbury, if you'll wait here for us," and smiling at her, a friendly smile that warmed her chilled heart like a burst of sudden sunshine, he bowed himself away, and left the little beauty sitting alone by the rail.
<p>She leaned her elbows on the rail, her dimpled chin in her hands, and watched the foamy waves with tender eyes as she thought how bonny he was, her handsome new acquaintance. Almost nicer, indeed, than Clifford Standish, or at least he would be, but for his absurd prejudice against her going on the stage.
<p>"Won't Cissy be surprised when I have another handsome caller? I suppose she'll be cross, and wonder where I got another string to my bow," thought the budding coquette, with artless vanity.
<p>She decided not to tell Cissy of the actor's strange conduct, for she would only say that he did it on purpose, and that it served her right.
<p>"And I shall not give her the chance to crow over me, and say, 'I told you so!'" murmured Geraldine.
<p>In the preoccupation of her mind, she did not notice that the rail she leaned on was old and weak, and had been mended at that very place. In the sudden indignation at the thought of Cissy's contumacy, she leaned yet more heavily upon it, and, with a sudden snap, the frail support gave way, precipitating its lovely burden into the water.
<p>"Heaven have mercy!" shrieked poor Geraldine, as she went downward over the side of the boat - down, down down, into the churning, frothy waves.
<p>In a moment all was terror, bustle, and confusion, the passengers all crowding to the side to look over, almost precipitating another accident in the excitement.
<p>"Give way!" cried a stern, ringing voice, as the tall form of the fireman pushed through the crowd, and he demanded, hoarsely:
<p>"What has happened?"
<p>And a dozen voices answered that there had been an accident to the young lady he had been with just now. The rail on which she leaned had broken, throwing her into the water.
<p>"My God!" he cried, supplicatingly, and sprang over the side to the rescue of the drowning girl!
<p>Several moments of keenest suspense ensued, while the noisy and excited crowd watched the water where Geraldine's fair head had gone down beneath the surface.
<p>Harry Hawthorne made a bold and gallant dive through the eddying circles on the water, and for a few breathless moments, he, too, was lost to sight.
<p>The people shouted, in dismay and pity:
<p>"They are both lost! They have been sucked under the boat by the swift current!"
<p>Every face grew sad at the thought, and some tender-hearted women burst into tears.
<p>It seemed terrible that those two beautiful young lives should have gone down so suddenly and tragically into the darkness of death.
<p>But, suddenly, a low murmur of joy rose above the lamentations.
<p>"See! see!"
<p>The dark head of Harry Hawthorne had reappeared above the waves.
<p>In another moment it was seen that he held Geraldine clasped to him with one arm, her white, unconscious face and dripping hair upturned to the light.
<p>Supporting himself as best he could with one free arm, he halooed, loudly:
<p>"Boat! boat!"
<p>Oh, what a ringing cheer answered him - shouts of joy at the rescue; shouts of praise at his bravery!
<p>In the meanwhile the steamer had been stopped, and a little boat let down. The men rowed quickly to Hawthorne, and drew him and his burden into safety.
<p>The whole affair had passed off very quickly, but only the strength and bravery of one man had saved pretty Geraldine from a grave beneath the deep, sparkling waves of the beautiful Hudson.
<p>As it was, she had sustained no injury, and soon recovered consciousness, looking about her with dazed eyes, to find her rescuer kneeling by her side, gazing at her with eager, dark-blue eyes, full of yearning anxiety.
<p>"Oh, you need not look so frightened, Mr. Hawthorne. She is all right now, and I'm going to take her down stairs and lend her some of my dry clothes!" cried a gay voice, and the pretty young married woman to whom he had been about to introduce Geraldine when she fell into the river, now took the girl in charge and led her down stairs, saying, cheerily:
<p>"You'll be all right directly. I'm going to get you some wine, and have you lie down and rest a while when you get on some dry clothes. Oh, you don't know my name, do you?
<p>"I am Mrs. Stansbury, and Harry Hawthorne was bringing me over to see you when you fell into the water. A mercy you wern't drowned, isn't it? You certainly would have been, only for his bravery."
<p>Closeted in the little state-room, she continued:
<p>"How fortunate that I brought along a little steamer trunk, expecting to spend several days with my mother in Newburgh. I can lend you an outfit, for we are almost the same size, aren't we? But I'll wager that Harry Hawthorne will not be able to borrow a suit big enough for him, and will have to remain 'in durance vile' until his own clothes are dry."
<p>Her words proved true, and she and Geraldine did not see the handsome fireman again until just before they landed, when he joined them, looking fresh and bright, and none the worse for his ducking, excusing his absence by saying, gayly, that he had been hung over a line to dry.
<p>His eager eyes sought Geraldine's, and he said, tenderly:
<p>"You feel no worse for your wetting, I hope?"
<p>"No, indeed, thanks to the coddling of Mrs. Stansbury and the other ladies, but" - and her low voice broke with grateful emotion - "how can I ever thank you enough?"
<p>"Let my own keen joy in saving your life be my reward," he answered, lightly, but with an undercurrent of joy in his deep, musical voice, for it seemed to him that had she perished beneath the cruel, darkling waves, life would never have seemed the same to him again.
<p>Yet he knew that it might never be possible to win her for his own. His rival, the handsome actor, might already be lord of her girlish heart.
<p>The bustle of landing cut short any further interchange of words between them, and when they stepped on shore, Mrs. Stansbury said, in her cordial way:
<p>"I have claimed Miss Harding for my mother's guest, and she will go with me to the ball to-night, and return to New York with you to-morrow. Now, I see mamma's carriage waiting. Will you come with us to luncheon before we go out to the parade?"
<p>"I thank you, no, for some of the fellows are waiting for me now. But I will see you later. Au revoir!"
<p>He smiled frankly at Geraldine, touched his cap, and hurried away, seeming to take away some of the sunshine with him, for her heart had gone out to him in a great wave of tenderness that blotted out the memory of Clifford Standish as though he had never existed.
<p>She looked at her companion, and asked, naively:
<p>"Why did you say I would go to the ball? I have no dress to wear."
<p>"What does that matter? I have several sisters. One of them can lend you a white silk, I'm sure. Why, you pretty darling, I wouldn't have you miss that ball for the world! Perhaps you will meet your fate there!"
<p>It seemed like a pretty act in a new play to Geraldine, the crowding events of that delightful day.
<p>To be welcomed so cordially by Mrs. Stansbury's gentle mother, to ride through the crowded and gayly decorated streets, in the private carriage, to the hospitable red brick house full of pretty fun-loving girls, and to be installed as an honored guest in a dainty chamber, was a treat to the little working-girl whose life flowed in such a narrow groove of toil and poverty, and she thought, generously:
<p>"Oh, I am very fortunate to find such kind friends, and I will always love them for their goodness to me. How I wish Cissy had come with me, for she would enjoy this so much."
<p>Mrs. Stansbury entered with a great fluff of silk and lace over her arm, saying, cheerily:
<p>"Here's the ball-gown I promised for to-night - Carrie's gown that she wore when she graduated last year. No, she doesn't need it. She has a blue silk-and-chiffon affair for the ball; so you'll be all right, won't you? And now let's go and have our luncheon, for we must hurry down town, where we have windows engaged to sit in and watch the parade. Oh, dear, I'm so sorry that my hubby, the captain, couldn't get away and come with us!"
<p>They had a delightful luncheon, very enjoyable after their morning on the water, then the party of six - Mrs. Stansbury, her mother, Mrs. Odell, and her three daughters, Carrie, Consuelo, and Daisy, with pretty Geraldine - set out for the centre of attraction, Newburgh's "triangular square" at the junction of Water and Colden streets. Here the party had two large plate-glass windows over a splendid dry-goods store. From this vantage ground the scene presented, as the magnificent parade filed past, was one to be treasured long in memory.
<p>It was a glittering spectacle, with thirty companies in line, and almost as many bands. Newburgh had not seen such a great day as this for years, with its glorious sunshine, brilliant uniforms, dazzling apparatus, splendid music, and throngs of appreciative people.
<p>The crowd was enormous, the broad pavements packed with a living mass of humanity; the door-ways, balconies, windows, house-tops, a sea of faces. When the dazzling pageant swept by, the effect was kaleidoscopic. The bright gay uniforms of the fine-looking men, the beautiful caparisons of the prancing horses, the heavily plated, imposing engines, the light and graceful carriages, with their paintings and stripings, their images and lamps, their glass-and-gold reel-heads, their silver and gold jackets - all gleamed and glittered in the flashing sunlight like an Arabian Night's dream, and the hearty applause of the gazing crowds made the welkin ring.
<p>Geraldine was charmed with everything, and her lovely, smiling face caught the upraised admiring glance of many a gallant fireman as the long column of thirty companies swept past to the ringing martial music of the accompanying bands. She forgot all her resentment against Cissy in her poignant regret that her chum was missing all this splendor and enjoyment.
<p>But, strange to say, not one regretful thought wandered toward her lost cavalier, Clifford Standish.
<p>She had forgotten him for the time, and her whole soul was thrilled with the present - permeated, enraptured with the thought of Harry Hawthorne, the handsome, dashing fireman who had so nobly saved her life. She loved him already, but she did not know her heart's language yet - her heart that had already elected him its king.
<p>What though his position was an humble one, it was equal to hers, and Geraldine had never reflected that beauty like her own ought to win her a fine rich lover. She was in a whirl of bliss at the all-pervading thought that she had met her fate at last.
<p>"He is mine, and I am his," ran the secret voice of her tender heart.
<p>She watched the firemen eagerly as they paraded past, hoping for a sight of his face among them, so she did not hear the door open behind her until a hand touched her shoulder and she looked up with a start, her voice unconsciously betraying the rapture of her heart as she cried:
<p>"Oh-h-h! - I thought you were in the parade!"
<p>He smiled, radiantly, his heart thrilling with joy.
<p>"No, I am not in the parade. That is, I chose not to be. You see, my company did not come, to take part, only a few of us fellows, so we can do as we like. We were offered seats in the carriages with the visiting firemen, and the others accepted. But I - I thought I would return and remain with you ladies."
<p>His voice said "ladies," but his eyes said "you," and Geraldine thrilled deliciously.
<p>Oh, how gay and happy she felt - happier than she had ever been in her whole life before. The dawn of love made the whole world roseate with sunshine.
<p>And never had she looked more beautiful. The joy in her heart sent the warm blood leaping through her veins and made her eyes brighter, her cheeks redder, until she was dazzlingly lovely.
<p>Harry Hawthorne remained with the party all the rest of the afternoon. Other young men joined them presently, admirers of the pretty Odell girls, and later on they repaired to the County Fair Grounds to witness some of the firemen's games taking place there.
<p>Seated on the grand stand, by the side of Geraldine, Harry Hawthorne felt as proud and happy as a king, for the same sweet wine of Love that thrilled the girl flowed intoxicatingly through his veins.
<p>The tournament and games of this afternoon were only a repetition by Newburgh firemen of the ones that had been participated in the previous day by the visiting companies - "consolation races," the chief merrily called them.
<p>But the grand stand was packed and the entertainment was novel and interesting, as evidenced by the frequent applause of the crowd.
<p>The exercises after the pretty tournament consisted mainly of hose-racing contests, in which firemanic skill was displayed at its best.
<p>"You must explain the game to me. You see, I never thought much about firemen before, although I am deeply interested in them now," pretty Geraldine said, naively, to her delighted companion.
<p>He thanked her with a kindling glance of pleasure, and answered:
<p>"It will give me pleasure to explain it all to you, Miss Harding. It is very simple indeed, depending on the skill and dexterity of the men. In the first place, the rules of the game require fifteen men. They must run two hundred yards to the hydrant, with a hose cart, and from that point lay one hundred yards of hose, make a coupling, and screw on the pipe. But these technical terms are Greek to you, of course, so I will try to make it clear to you as they proceed."
<p>He did so, and Geraldine, who was beginning to love all firemen, for the sake of the splendid one by her side, watched the contest with breathless interest.
<p>But now arose a difficulty.
<p>The Newburgh company had only fourteen good runners, and they must have a fifteenth one.
<p>But the rules of the race required that no company should make use of the services of a member of another company.
<p>It was finally decided that as the race was not for a prize, but simply for practice and amusement, the rule might be waived for one in favor of a visiting fireman.
<p>Then a murmur arose among the firemen that suddenly swelled to a clamorous shout:
<p>"Hawthorne! Hawthorne!"
<p>Mrs. Stansbury, who sat on the other side of Geraldine, looked round, and exclaimed, gayly:
<p>"They are calling you, Mr. Hawthorne. Why don't you go?"
<p>"I prefer remaining here," he smiled back, though a slight flush rose to his brow as the calls continued more clamorously:
<p>"Hawthorne! Hawthorne! Hawthorne!"
<p>All eyes turned on him as he sat unmoved, and a delegation of firemen came to insist on his joining the race.
<p>"Oh, do go, Mr. Hawthorne. I think it will be grand to join the race!" exclaimed Geraldine, enthusiastically, and he rose at once like a gallant knight who has no other wish than to do the behest of his lady-love.
<p>Mrs. Stansbury whispered as he went away:
<p>"He will win the race for them. He is a magnificent athlete, my husband says. And as for horses - well, you should see him control them! They love and obey him like a master, and he has a passion for them. He is a splendid fellow, though there is something rather mysterious about him. He has been driver for No. 17 two years, yet no one knows where he came from or aught about his family. But he is educated above his position, and has betrayed that he has lived abroad. We think he is English or Irish - perhaps a mixture of both. But, anyway, he is just magnificent, and the men and the horses both worship him alike. He has been a hero at dozens of fires, and has several medals of honor, but he will not accept promotion. He says he loves the horses, and will not give up driving. But look! the team is about to start!"
<p>Every word she uttered only made Geraldine love Hawthorne more dearly, for what woman does not love a hero?
<p>Geraldine watched the contest with flashing eyes; but, needless to say, she saw but one man, and she soon realized that the most thunderous applause was given to him.
<p>"He is the swiftest runner of them all!" cried Carrie Odell. "Look how the men are dropping off! They cannot stand it. Seven, eight, nine, ten, have given up. Oh-h-h!"
<p>"Another! And another!" cried her sister, Consuelo, and so it kept on till when they reached the finish they had only two men to open the hydrant, and screw on the pipe - a simple operation it would seem to a novice, but it is just here that the race is won or lost. Under the moment's excitement the couplers will likely find their nerves unsteady after the long run. But these two men made no false moves. They put on the pipe with indescribable speed, then ran on the remaining hundred yards to the judge's stand, Harry Hawthorne coming out ahead amid the deafening cheers of his admirers.
<p>The judges took the time at the very instant that the pipe touched the ground, and after examining the coupling they found it all right, and announced the time as forty-six and one-fourth seconds.
<p>The victors retired amid tumultuous applause, and another team prepared to run, Hawthorne returning very soon to Geraldine's side to sun himself in her admiring eyes.
<p>"You were splendid, and I was proud of you!" she cried, innocently, unconscious of the tenderness her words implied.
<p>"Thank you. I am proud that I pleased you; but I was sorry they made me run. I was trying to keep rested and fresh to dance with you at the ball to-night," he answered, lightly.
<p>"And now you will be too tired - I am sorry for that."
<p>How frankly she could talk to him, and yet they had been strangers only this morning; yet it seemed as if they had known each other years and years.
<p>"No, I shall not be too weary to dance with you," he answered, tenderly.
<p>Then others of the party claimed his attention, and Geraldine sat in a happy dream, thinking how heavenly it would be dancing with him to-night.
<p>Presently the games were over, and the weary, happy throng departed - the Odells and their guests to make ready for the grand fireman's ball they were going to attend that night.
<p>"Oh, I wonder what Cissy will say when I don't come back to-night? She will be uneasy about me; perhaps angry. But she will forgive me when I tell her how it happened, and what a lovely time I had," thought Geraldine.
<p>But again she did not even think of Clifford Standish, or even wonder what had become of him. She was full of the dear, delightful present.
<p>How delightful it was to be dressing for a grand ball, in white slippers and a fairy-like gown of white silk, and with white roses for her breast and hair. Geraldine felt like a Cinderella going to the ball with a prince, for Harry Hawthorne was coming to be her escort, and to her he was the handsomest man on earth, a veritable Prince Charming.
<p>She looked at her reflection in the long mirror, with artless delight at her own beauty.
<p>"How pretty I look! I hope he will think so, too, but perhaps he knows some one more beautiful," she murmured, uneasily.
<p>Oh, how Geraldine enjoyed the first two hours of the ball!
<p>It was one of the most brilliant affairs ever given in Newburgh.
<p>The dazzling lights shone on an animated scene, adorned with rich floral garnitures, and brightened by the rich uniforms of the firemen, mixed with the sober black of the ordinary citizen, and the gay gowns of the beautiful women.
<p>Geraldine, with her golden fluff of hair, bright brown eyes, and shining white attire, was the cynosure of all eyes, and many a gallant fireman envied Harry Hawthorne, who was her partner so often in the joyous dance.
<p>True, she would dance with any of them to whom he introduced her, but each one saw by the wandering glances of her brown eyes that Hawthorne was first in her heart and thoughts.
<p>So the first two hours passed by like a dream of bliss.
<p>Geraldine loved music and dancing and gayety, with all her heart. She loved, too, the congenial new friends she had made, and lost in the delightful present, she forgot for a time her feverish ambition to become an actress and shine upon the stage.
<p>What exquisite rapture may be crowded into two hours - rapture that will linger in the memory till death blots out all. So it was with Geraldine.
<p>When Hawthorne pressed her hand in the dance, and looked into her eyes, drinking in deep draughts the intoxication of her beauty and sweetness, the girl thrilled with a rapture akin to pain, and those moments of dizzy, subtle bliss so dazzling in their brightness, returned to Geraldine through all her life as her happiest hours - that hour in a woman's life when First Love "is a shy, sweet new-comer, and Hope leads it by the hand."
<p>How sad that a shadow should fall so suddenly over Geraldine's happiness!
<p>But as she stood at a window, panting from the dance, rosy and smiling, as she talked to Harry Hawthorne, a shadow suddenly came between her and the light, pausing by her side till she looked up and saw - Clifford Standish!
<p>Alas! that his shadow should ever come between her and the dawning happiness of her life!
<p>Alas! that she had ever met him, the handsome, unscrupulous actor, who stood there scowling at his splendid rival!
<p>"Mr. Standish!" she exclaimed, with a violent start, and a strange feeling of annoyance, and he answered, impressively:
<p>"How glad I am that I have found you at last!"
<p>"Have you been looking for me?" she asked, coldly.
<p>"Everywhere! And I beg ten thousand pardons for my seeming desertion of you. It was wholly an accident, and the fault of my friend, who detained me talking one minute too long. I followed you on the next steamer, but it was several hours late, and all the time my mind was distracted over what would become of you. Of course I knew you would find friends - a beautiful girl alone in a crowd will always find a protector; but," sneeringly, "not always a safe one!"
<p>"I beg your pardon. It was I who protected Miss Harding," began Harry Hawthorne, wrathfully, and the girl started, and exclaimed:
<p>"Mr. Standish, this is Mr. Hawthorne, a very kind gentleman who paid my fare on the boat after you left me without a ticket, and afterward jumped into the river and saved my life when I fell overboard. I owe him a debt of gratitude that I can never repay."
<p>They bowed coldly, trying not to glare, each seeing in the other a dangerous rival.
<p>Clifford Standish was not pleasant to look at with that steely glare in his large, light-blue eyes, and that angry compression of his shaven lips as he said, coldly:
<p>"I thank you, sir, for your care of my friend during my enforced absence from her side. I will repay you the boat fare, and remain deeply indebted to you for saving her life. Of course it goes without saying that I shall now be honored with her company again, thus relieving you of her care."
<p>Harry Hawthorne, with a dangerous flash in his dark-blue eyes, retorted, calmly:
<p>"I beg your pardon. Her engagement with me for this evening gives me a right that I shall not relinquish unless at her desire."
<p>Both looked at the beautiful, flushed face of the girl. She comprehended the sudden hate between them, and said, tremblingly, but with the sweet tones of the peacemaker:
<p>"I think Mr. Hawthorne is right. My engagement with you was for to-day, and we were to have returned to-night, you know. But after you left me alone on the boat, I made new friends, and a very sweet, kind lady, well-known to Mr. Hawthorne, took charge of me and invited me to be her guest while I staid in Newburgh. It was under her chaperonage I came to the ball, and, with her consent, I accepted the escort of Mr. Hawthorne. I cannot break my engagement with him, and I have promised, also, to go back to New York in his care to-morrow."
<p>Every word she uttered maddened him with secret fury. His face was livid as he almost hissed:
<p>"I should like to see this lady who chaperoned you here. How do I know that she is a proper person!" he began, insolently, but at that moment a lady tapped him smartly on the arm with her fan, exclaiming:
<p>"Ha, ha, ha! I like that, Mr. Standish! A proper person indeed. Well, I'm the person, and if you have any fault to find with me, my husband, Captain Stansbury, will settle it with you."
<p>"Miss Odell!" he exclaimed, recoiling in surprise from the sight of the face of an old acquaintance.
<p>"Mrs. Stansbury, please," she corrected him, then went on, gayly: "Do you remember our flirtation at Asbury Park three years ago? I haven't seen you since, have I? Well, I've been married two years now to the finest man in New York. But my sisters are single yet. Come with me and pay your respects to them before the german begins."
<p>She dragged him reluctantly away, and then Hawthorne said, angrily:
<p>"That fellow was inclined to be insolent, and I could scarcely refrain from pitching him neck and heels through this window!"
<p>"Oh, please, please, do not get into any trouble with him on my account!" pleaded Geraldine. "He has been very kind to me, really, and I should not wish to offend him!"
<p>"Do not tell me he is your lover - that you care for him!" exclaimed the young man, jealously.
<p>"N-n-o, he is only a friend!" she faltered, and was glad when her partner for the next dance came to claim her hand.
<p>She knew in her heart that Clifford Standish regarded her with more than a friendly liking, but she was not prepared to own it to impetuous Harry Hawthorne, so she was glad to get away from his inquisitive looks and words.
<p>But the joy of the evening was ended now for pretty Geraldine.
<p>Clifford Standish soon escaped from the Odell girls, and haunted Geraldine the rest of the time, not offensively, but with the assurance of a favored lover, torturing the poor girl who could not bear to wound his feelings, but whose reserved and distrait manner did not discourage his persistent gallantry, for he stood his ground, debarring the lovers from any pleasure in each other's society.
<p>Once Hawthorne whispered to her, fiercely:
<p>"There comes that cad back. He is annoying you. I see it by your altered looks. Will you not allow me to pitch him out of the window?"
<p>"No - oh, no, you must not make a scene!" she shuddered, apprehensively.
<p>"Then tell him yourself that you are weary of his persistent following," he urged.
<p>"Oh, no, I cannot wound him so. He has been kind to me, and means no harm," she said, trying to make excuses that she felt he did not deserve.
<p>But she escaped from the ball as soon as she could, glad to be rid of him, and spent a restless night, repenting the encouragement she had given Standish before she met Hawthorne.
<p>"They both love me, and I can see that they will be bitter foes," she thought, in terror of some unknown evil.
<p>The next morning Standish came at an early hour to call. He was acquainted with the girls, and they tried by merry banter to drive the threatening gloom from his brow; but all their efforts were dismal failures. He had eyes only for Geraldine, who was pale and perturbed under his reproachful glances, that seemed to say, bitterly:
<p>"You are a cruel little coquette. You encouraged me to love you until you met that other fellow, and now you wish to throw me over."
<p>Samuel M. Peck.
<p>It was a great relief to Geraldine when Harry Hawthorne arrived with a cab to take her to the boat. Now at last she could escape her angry lover.
<p>He rose, indeed, to take leave of the family, but he said to her:
<p>"I shall see you again, Miss Harding. I go back to New York on the same boat."
<p>He did so, but he did not judge it prudent to incur the wrath of Hawthorne by too persistent attentions. He preserved a coolly courteous demeanor toward both, devoting himself to some other friends whom he met on the boat.
<p>But, toward the last, he approached Geraldine again, murmuring, pleadingly:
<p>"I should like to call on you this evening, if you will permit me."
<p>She blushed, and stammered:
<p>"Please excuse me, as I have another engagement."
<p>He saw her timid glance turn toward Hawthorne, and readily guessed that she had made an engagement with him.
<p>Stifling an execration between closely drawn lips, he muttered:
<p>"To-morrow evening, then?"
<p>"Oh, yes, certainly," she answered, but with an air of restraint that made him furious.
<p>"She would like to refuse if she dared, the little flirt," he thought, and when Geraldine and Hawthorne left the boat together, he looked after them pale with rage.
<p>At that moment Cameron Clemens, one of the actor-friends he had met on the boat, slapped him on the shoulder, and said, teasingly:
<p>"Hallo, Standish! that was a stunning little beauty! But what are you glowering at, man? Jealous, eh?"
<p>"Jealous of a beggarly fireman? Bah, no! The little coquette will throw him over to-morrow."
<p>"And pick you up again, eh? Consolatory, by Jove! But who is she, anyhow?"
<p>"Oh, nobody but a salesgirl from O'Neill's. She scraped acquaintance with me in the store some ten days ago, and has been begging me to get her in my company ever since. You know how the pretty girls always run after actors, Clemens."
<p>"And how ardently the actors encourage their attentions; oh, yes," smiled the other, who was a very handsome young fellow himself. He added, after a moment: "Is the girl stage-struck?"
<p>"Yes, decidedly - member of an amateur dramatic society, and all that, you know. Wild to go on the stage, and I intend to get her in our company, just before we go on the road next week."
<p>"But there's no vacancy."
<p>"I'll get that little soubrette turned off. I owe her a grudge anyhow. She slapped my face when I tried to kiss her in a dark corridor one night."
<p>"Oh, don't take revenge for that. She's a good little girl, that Bettie," said Cameron Clemens, who, although he was the villain in the play where Standish had the part of hero, was kind and generous at heart.
<p>But Clifford Standish could not be brought to relent.
<p>"She can get another place," he said, carelessly. "The manager can't afford to displease me. I'm drawing full houses every night. So out goes prudish Bettie, and in comes pretty Geraldine!"
<p>"You don't think you can kiss her in a dark corridor, do you?"
<p>"I shall kiss her when I please. In fact, I intend to marry the little beauty; so no attentions in that quarter, my friend."
<p>"All right. I'll keep off the grass," returned the young actor, slangily, and turning to his friend, Charlie Butler, they went away together, leaving Standish to some bitter reflections, for his bravado was all put on. He feared that Geraldine was lost to him forever.
<p>"He will be with her this evening, that villainous fireman, while I am plodding away on the stage," he thought, angrily.
<p>But a most untoward fate helped him on when he feared that the game was lost to him forever - helped him on, and blighted all the springing hopes of poor Harry Hawthorne.
<p>A morbid curiosity over his rival led him to stroll down on Ludlow street that afternoon, in the neighborhood of the engine-house, and he saw the horses dashing out attached to the engine, and the hated Hawthorne on the driver's seat, handling the reins with consummate skill, his handsome face aglow with excitement. An alarm of fire had come in, and he was hastening to the scene.
<p>Clifford Standish hated his manly rival more than ever at this moment, but he impulsively joined the crowd that was running after the engine, intent on seeing the fire.
<p>On went the engine in splendid style, the horses obeying Hawthorne's hand lovingly, their sleek sides shining, their manes streaming, their fine heads erect, their large eyes flashing, a sight to win the admiration of every gazer. Flying like the wind, their hoofs striking fire from the pavement, they turned the corner, and - - Alas! what was that shriek that went up from hundreds of throats?
<p>Their splendid onset was defeated. In turning the corner the wheels struck a car track at an angle, and the engine was overturned, the gallant steeds struggling in the dust with their noble driver.
<p>Clifford Standish rushed forward with demoniac glee, muttering:
<p>"My rival is dead beneath the engine! I am free of him forever!"
<p>It almost seemed as if Clifford Standish was destined to realize his diabolical hopes of his rival's death.
<p>When Harry Hawthorne was drawn from his perilous position at the heels of the horses, he was found to be unconscious, and the blood pouring from a wound on his head.
<p>An ambulance was called to convey him to the hospital, and the physician in charge looked very serious over the case.
<p>"It is impossible to say yet whether he is mortally injured or not. He may simply be stunned from the bad cut on his head, or he may have sustained internal injuries," he said to the anxious crowd about him, and then the wounded man was lifted carefully into the ambulance, and driven to the Bellevue Hospital.
<p>Clifford Standish turned away from the scene with a diabolical smile of triumph on his thin lips, hissing cruelly:
<p>"The Fates have played me a good turn, and I will make the most of my opportunity. Whether Harry Hawthorne lives or dies, I will come between him and Geraldine so effectually that when he returns to her it will be impossible to win her from me. Of course, I shall not go near her this evening. She must be kept in ignorance of his accident, if possible, so that she may think he has forsaken her. Ha, ha, ha! what a weary waiting she will have for him this evening, and how angry she will be because he has broken his engagement."
<p>Geraldine did, indeed, have a weary waiting for her lover, and her disappointment was keen and bitter at his failure to come.
<p>But so absolute was her faith in him that she did not become angry, but thought, excusingly:
<p>"Something has happened to detain him, surely. Perhaps he was called out to some dreadful fire. I shall be sure to receive a note from him to-morrow, explaining all, craving my pardon, and appointing another date to call."
<p>She was so anxious, too, for Cissy to see him. She felt sure that her friend would like him better than she had liked Clifford Standish.
<p>When she reached home that day, she rested a while, then went down to the store, and remained until closing time, returning with Cissy, who was cold and indifferent, for Geraldine's non-return the night before had filled her with alarm over the fate of the willful girl.
<p>But Geraldine, eager for her friend's sympathy, put aside her former petulance, and poured into Cissy's ear the story of the day and night - the accident that had deprived her of the actor's company - the new friends she had made, her fall into the water, her rescue, her charming time at Newburgh - except that her girlish heart had gone from her own keeping into that of noble, handsome, tender Harry Hawthorne.
<p>But Cissy did not need to be told the latter. She read it in the blush and smile of the innocent girl.
<p>"Oh, Cissy, I want you to promise me to come in and see him to-night," pleaded Geraldine, humbly. "I am sure you will be charmed with him, he is so good and so handsome."
<p>"So you said of Mr. Standish," reminded Cissy.
<p>Geraldine blushed, but answered, warmly:
<p>"I know I did; but - Mr. Hawthorne is nicer than the actor - oh, ever so much nicer! And" - slyly - "you will like him, Cissy, because he is as much opposed to my going on the stage as you are."
<p>"Then I shall cultivate his acquaintance," declared Cissy, beamingly.
<p>And she was almost as anxious for his coming that night as Geraldine was herself.
<p>But, as we have seen, both were disappointed.
<p>Harry Hawthorne lay ill and suffering at the hospital, and there was no one to tell Geraldine the story of his accident.
<p>Her young heart was heavy with pain and wonder all the next day, but still no message came to explain or excuse his failure to keep his engagement.
<p>Only some fair young girl as loving and tender as our sweet Geraldine, who has been disappointed as she was, can realize her silent grief that day as she stood behind the counter, patiently waiting on exacting customers and trying to seem cheerful and interested when she was longing to be alone in her own room, to bury her head in the pillow and have a good, comforting cry.
<p>She was wretched with doubt and suspense.
<p>And only yesterday she had been so wildly happy.
<p>Late in the afternoon Clifford Standish came into the store to buy a pair of gloves.
<p>He was bright, smiling, and elegant as ever, and chatted gayly with Geraldine.
<p>"I have some good news for you this evening," he whispered, but the girl scarcely smiled.
<p>She knew that he would not bring her any tidings of Harry Hawthorne, and it seemed to her that she cared for nothing else.
<p>How strange is love when it enters the heart as a guest, shutting out interest in everything else - strange, subtle, sweet, and absorbingly selfish.
<p>Geraldine forgot how well she had liked the actor, and how she had quarreled with Cissy for his sake.
<p>His attentions were repugnant to her now, and she wished ardently to be rid of him.
<p>But her tender, girlish heart reproached her for her fickleness, and she thought it would seem ungrateful to snub him now.
<p>So she only smiled at him plaintively, assuming an interest she did not feel.
<p>Bending across the counter, he whispered, so that Cissy could not hear:
<p>"I beg your pardon, but did your new admirer - did he call last night?"
<p>"No-o," faltered the girl, and she could hardly keep the tears from her eyes.
<p>"Why, that is strange. What prevented him from keeping his engagement?"
<p>"I do not know."
<p>"You have not heard from him?" he exclaimed, in surprise.
<p>"Not a word," she sighed, then added, quickly: "But I don't think he meant to break his engagement. Perhaps there was a fire, and he had to go."
<p>"Very likely - but, then, he should have sent you an apology early this morning."
<p>"Do you think so? Oh, I suppose he will come and explain in person," said Geraldine, with assumed indifference.
<p>Another customer bustled up to claim her attention, and he bowed himself away, secretly exultant over the fact that she was utterly ignorant of Harry Hawthorne's fate.
<p>"There is no one to come and tell her, and even if it gets into the papers, she is not likely to read it. A poor working-girl has little time for reading," he reflected.
<p>Again his evil genius favored him.
<p>When he went for his call on Geraldine that evening, he found a messenger-boy in the street with a letter for her from the Bellevue Hospital.
<p>He took the letter from the boy, and gave him a quarter.
<p>"I am going in to see Miss Harding now. I will deliver the letter," he said, affably, and the boy, who was in a hurry to get home to his supper, thanked him for the service, and turned away, rejoicingly.
<p>The triumphant actor hid the letter in his breast, congratulating himself on having so easily obtained possession of it.
<p>"I am very fortunate, for had the fickle little beauty received it, all would have been explained between them."
<p>Geraldine came to the door to receive him, and he saw at once how much she had changed toward him by the simple fact that she had not adorned herself in her best gown, as usual, but wore her simple shop-gown of black serge.
<p>She did not care whether she looked fair to him or not, and he quickly realized it, for he was an adept in reading the complex nature of woman. But he hid his chagrin, saying, admiringly:
<p>"Perhaps you do not realize how pretty and demure you look in that black gown."
<p>"Thank you," Geraldine said, listlessly, as she sank into a chair opposite, and tried to seem friendly and interested.
<p>It made Clifford Standish secretly furious to see how near he had come to losing the charming little beauty on whom he had set his burning heart, and of whom he had felt so sure but a few days ago.
<p>Her pale and pensive looks, her drooping eyes, her pathetic red mouth, all told that her heart was far away, and in his heart he cursed himself for inviting her to go on that fateful excursion to Newburgh, by which he had almost lost her forever.
<p>But he had one chance now to retrieve his misstep, and he set about improving it.
<p>"Well, I will tell you the promised good news!" he exclaimed. "I have at last secured you the wished-for position in my company."
<p>"Oh!" cried Geraldine, starting, and clasping her little hands convulsively together.
<p>But the exclamation was one of dismay rather than of joy.
<p>His quick ear detected it, but he pretended to misapprehend her, and continued:
<p>"I knew you would be delighted to hear it."
<p>"Ye-es," she faltered, weakly; then bracing herself to escape the engagement. "But - but - perhaps I ought not to go on the stage. Cissy is opposed to it."
<p>"Yes, I know - you told me that at first, but you said, also, that you did not care for her opinions - that you should do as you pleased."
<p>Geraldine could not contradict him. It was perfectly true.
<p>She sat speechless and embarrassed, feeling like a little bird caught in the fowler's net, while he continued, smoothly:
<p>"Don't be afraid of Miss Carroll's displeasure. It's only envy and jealousy."
<p>Geraldine, in her resentment against Cissy, had said this to him, too, and she comprehended that he was cleverly turning her own weapons against her now. She could only sit mute and miserable, with a forced smile that was more pathetic than tears.
<p>Clifford Standish continued:
<p>"The position offered you is not as good as I could wish, but I shall manage to get you a promotion soon. Our soubrette is going to leave, and you can take her place as soon as you wish."
<p>It was strange how tenaciously Geraldine's mind clung to the dread of Harry Hawthorne's disapproval. She did not wish to go on the stage now, and was eager for a loophole to escape.
<p>"Oh, I don't think I'd like to take a soubrette's place," she cried.
<p>"But last week you said you wouldn't mind it."
<p>"Oh, why do you keep throwing up things I said last week?" she burst out, pettishly.
<p>"Do you wish to forget them so soon, Miss Harding? Then you must be very fickle-minded, and I am sorry that I had that poor soubrette discharged for your sake!"
<p>"For my sake! Oh-h-oh!"
<p>"Why, certainly; because you were so anxious for a place, and I wished to please you above all things," tenderly; "and, of course, you know the manager dare not refuse anything reasonable that I ask, so I persuaded him to discharge poor Bettina."
<p>"Oh, let her keep the place, do! It was cruel to turn her off."
<p>"It is too late to replace her now. She has accepted an offer from a company that is going to remain in New York, and I shall have no end of trouble getting another girl to fill the place. I thought you wanted the chance so badly," reproachfully.
<p>Geraldine flushed crimson, and the tears she had been fighting back brimmed over in her eyes.
<p>"Oh, I have acted abominably," she sobbed; "but - but - a girl has a right to change her mind, hasn't she?"
<p>"Certainly, if she doesn't mind putting every one out," stiffly.
<p>He rose as if to go, walked to the door as if in anger, then relented, and stood looking back with intense eyes that compelled her to look at him deprecatingly.
<p>Having gained this point, he said, gently:
<p>"We are going on the road with our company in one week, and as our soubrette can stay with us a few days longer, I'll give you three days to make up your mind whether you will take the place or not. For who knows but that you will change your mind again?" and still smiling kindly at her, he quoted:
<p>"Please go now," she answered, burying her face in her hands.
<p>"I am going now, but I shall come back to-morrow evening, and hope to find you in a brighter mood," he answered, going out softly and closing the door.
<p>He had purposely refrained from speaking of Harry Hawthorne, but he guessed well that it was he who had influenced her against the stage.
<p>"Curse his meddling! But it shall avail him nothing. I shall conquer in the end. I have sworn to make her mine, and mine she shall be, the coquettish little darling," he muttered, resolutely.
<p>The days came and went, while Geraldine waited patiently for the coming of Harry Hawthorne - waited all in vain, for he continued very ill at the hospital, and the note he had dictated to a nurse acquainting her with his accident she never received. It had fallen into the hands of his triumphant rival, Standish, who kept it hidden safely from that yearning young heart.
<p>Two more days passed by, and still Geraldine heard nothing of Harry Hawthorne.
<p>"Is it not strange - the way he has acted?" she said, at last, to Cissy, who answered:
<p>"Yes; he has behaved so shabbily that you ought to put him out of your thoughts, dear."
<p>"Oh, Cissy, do you believe that he never meant to come? That he was unworthy?" almost piteously.
<p>"I'm afraid so, Geraldine, for even if something had happened to keep him away that evening, he has had ample time to explain and apologize since then; but he has not done so, and it looks as if he was a sad flirt, and only amused himself with you for the time, without giving you another thought since he left you."
<p>Cissy believed what she said, and meant only kindness, but her frank words quivered like a thorn in Geraldine's heart.
<p>Oh, how could she think of him as an unprincipled flirt, awakening an interest in a young girl's heart only for his own amusement?
<p>But still she knew that such men existed, and that many broken hearts lay at their door.
<p>The dread that Harry Hawthorne might be one of these heartless men awoke to life within her a fierce and burning pride.
<p>"No man shall break my heart. I will forget Harry Hawthorne," she vowed, bitterly, to herself; and when the actor came that night, he found her bright and gay as of yore. She had put on over her tortured heart that mask of smiles which many a woman wears through life to deceive a carping world.
<p>Clifford Standish was charmed with her new mood. He saw that a reaction had begun.
<p>"I am glad to see you so happy, for I am sure that you have decided to go on the road with us," he exclaimed, coaxingly.
<p>She shook her head, and laughed, gayly:
<p>"Do not be too sure. You know you have given me until Sunday night to decide."
<p>"But that is not far off - only twenty-four hours," he said, with a smile, for he felt sure of victory. As she made no reply, he continued:
<p>"I have made a charming invitation for you for Sunday afternoon. Some of the leading members of our company are going to skate in the park to-morrow - you know this cold snap has frozen the lake beautifully - and they want me to bring you. Will you come?"
<p>"Yes," replied Geraldine, quickly, glad of a diversion for Sunday afternoon, so that she need not mope alone with her miserable thoughts of how Harry Hawthorne had flirted with her for his own amusement.
<p>For she had begun to lose faith in her handsome lover now. The leaven of Cissy's words had worked steadily in her mind.
<p>And a cruel self-shame that she had given her love in vain was at war with the tenderness of her heart.
<p>"Thank you. I am so glad you will go. I know you will like the trip and the company," he said; then, in a changed tone: "By the way, did that fireman ever keep his promise to call on you?"
<p>"No," she answered, carelessly.
<p>"Have you heard anything about him?"
<p>"No, indeed, and I had almost forgotten the man until you recalled him to my mind," she returned, fibbing unblushingly.
<p>"Ah! Then you will not mind what I have to tell you?" deprecatingly.
<p>"Of course not. What is it?" carelessly.
<p>"Well, of course, I thought it rude and strange his not keeping his appointment with you, and thinking something might have happened to the fellow, as you feared, I made some indirect inquiries at the engine-house, and found that he had returned to Newburgh the same day he brought you back to New York."
<p>"Indeed?" she returned, with a paling cheek, whose pallor she could not control.
<p>"Yes, he had gone back, but I did not like to tell you the truth. I waited for developments. But, to-day, I met Mrs. Stansbury on the street, and she told me something - well, see if you can guess?"
<p>"Something very amusing, no doubt," she replied, carelessly.
<p>"She told me she had just returned from Newburgh, and that she had left Hawthorne there, courting her sister, Daisy Odell. It seemed that he had been in love with the pretty little black-eyed thing some time, and fearing that she might get jealous of the attentions he had to pay you the day you were thrown on his care by my accidental desertion, he returned to make his peace with her, and has been lingering by her side ever since. Mrs. Stansbury was vastly amused over it all, and said to me, 'He flirted shockingly with that pretty little salesgirl, didn't he? but I hope she knew it was only fun! Give my love to her when you see her again!'"
<p>Geraldine treated the matter with a seeming careless indifference, but, oh! the tumult of wounded love and pride that raged within her girlish breast!
<p>"I was so fond of that woman, and she was only kind to me for the sake of a little amusement," she thought, with hot and burning cheeks at his tone when he repeated Mrs. Stansbury's contemptuous epithet, "that little salesgirl!"
<p>To herself she said, angrily:
<p>"I will not be a poor salesgirl any longer, to be twitted with my humble position in life. I will become an actress, and my talents will make me famous, so that these people will go to see me act, and be proud to say, 'I knew her once, but she is so rich and grand now that she would not stoop to renew the acquaintance.' As for Harry Hawthorne, who knows but that I may be able to pay him back some day for the slight he put on me! I am no longer grateful to him for saving my life; for why should he have saved it, only to plant a thorn in my heart?"
<p>But she did not tell Cissy what the actor had told her about Harry Hawthorne. She could not bear to confess her humiliation.
<p>But she went with Standish to the park the next day, and while skating on the lake a vision of beauty and grace that attracted the eyes of admiring hundreds, she told him that she had decided to go with the company on the road.
<p>"Although Cissy is very angry with me, and vows that I will repent it in dust and ashes," she added, uneasily.
<p>"Don't listen to her croaking. She only envies your good fortune," he returned, reassuringly. "Why, you will soon be rich and famous, Miss Harding, for your beauty and talent will win you rapid promotion on the boards. Do you see how all those strangers have watched you on the ice to-day? It is because your face has already won you the sobriquet of 'the prettiest salesgirl in New York.' Soon it will be changed to 'the prettiest actress on the stage.' Will not that sound better?"
<p>Harry Hawthorne remained in the Bellevue Hospital ten days only, it having been discovered that his injuries were not internal, as at first feared.
<p>His temporary unconsciousness had resulted from the severe cut on his head, and as this healed nicely, he grew better, and asked for his discharge from the hospital. Indeed, he would have recovered sooner but for a painful suspense and anxiety that augmented fever and restlessness.
<p>The young fireman had been so deeply smitten by the charms of pretty Geraldine, that during his enforced confinement, the thought of her had never been absent from his mind. Love had sprung to life full grown within his breast.
<p>When he was discharged from the hospital, he could not wait until evening to call on her. The ready excuse of the need of a pair of gloves took him to O'Neill's.
<p>He did not wear his fireman's dress, but attired himself in an elegant suit of clothes, such as gentlemen wear to business. Thus arrayed, and looking as much the aristocrat as any Fifth avenue millionaire, he entered the store and went at once to the glove counter, his heart throbbing wildly at thought of seeing Geraldine again, and making an appointment to call on her that evening.
<p>A whole row of smiling, pretty girls confronted him, but among them all he could not see his heart's darling, the lode-star of his dreams - sweet Geraldine.
<p>He accosted the nearest girl - a plump, gray-eyed beauty - who fortunately proved to be Miss Carroll.
<p>"I wish to have Miss Harding show me some gloves. Is she here?"
<p>Cissy Carroll shook her dark head, and answered:
<p>"Geraldine does not attend here any more. Can I show you the gloves?"
<p>"If you please," he replied, and as she placed them before him, he took a pair, mechanically, in his shapely hand, but continued:
<p>"I beg your pardon, but has Miss Harding gone to another store? She is a friend of mine. I wish to see her very much."
<p>"Your name?" asked Cissy, with a quick suspicion of the truth, for he realized in his person Geraldine's description.
<p>"I am Harry Hawthorne."
<p>"I thought so. And I am Miss Carroll. Perhaps you have heard Geraldine speak of me?"
<p>He smiled, and answered:
<p>"Yes, as her 'chum Cissy.' She told me, also, that you roomed together."
<p>"We did - but Geraldine has left me now."
<p>She read the palpable disappointment on his face, and added, quickly:
<p>"She had a talent for acting, and has gone upon the stage."
<p>She saw him start as if she had struck him a blow in the face, and he grew lividly pale, as he asked:
<p>"At what theatre?"
<p>"Oh, she has left New York, and gone on the road with a stock company - the one that played 'Hearts and Homes' two weeks here. You may remember Clifford Standish, the leading man. He procured the situation for Geraldine."
<p>Then, as she saw from his face that he was taking it quite hard, she added, with womanly curiosity:
<p>"But how happens it that you are not acquainted with these facts? The papers had some very flattering paragraphs about the beautiful salesgirl who had left a New York store to adopt a stage career."
<p>"I - I - haven't read the papers," he murmured, faintly, like one recovering from a blow.
<p>"Oh, then you must have been away from New York - and poor Geraldine expecting you to call every evening. Why didn't you let her know?"
<p>"I haven't been away from the city, Miss Carroll."
<p>"Then why did you act toward her so shabbily?"
<p>"Shabbily! Why I had a note written to her from the hospital, explaining that an accident had overturned my engine and seriously wounded me. I've been in Bellevue Hospital ten days, Miss Carroll. Look," and he showed her the scar on his head.
<p>"Oh, it's a wonder you were not killed," said the girl, sympathetically.
<p>"They thought I was at first, for I didn't recover consciousness until the next day. Then, as soon as I could think clearly at all, I thought of my broken engagement of the evening before, and wondered what she would think of me. I persuaded the nurse to write a little note for me, as I was too shaky myself, and sent it by the messenger-boy at the hospital. I hoped she would write me a line of sympathy, and that - perhaps - she might even be sorry enough to come and see me there. But I never received a word!"
<p>"She did not receive your note. Your failure to come was a mystery to her always, Mr. Hawthorne."
<p>"Why, that is very strange. I'll go back to the hospital and see that messenger. But - will you give me her address now?" eagerly. "I will write to her and explain."
<p>Cissy blushed vividly, and said:
<p>"I am sorry that I cannot, but the fact is I don't know where she is, for - we parted in anger, vowing to have no more to do with each other. I disliked Clifford Standish, and tried to persuade her not to go on the stage. She went in defiance of my advice - so she has not written to me."
<p>Miss Carroll was sorry for the young fireman, as she saw how pale and troubled his handsome face became at her tidings.
<p>She exclaimed, sympathetically:
<p>"Maybe Geraldine will get over her anger and write to me yet. She never stays angry long at a time. So, if she writes, I'll let you know."
<p>"Thank you, a hundred times over," gratefully, "and may I call on you sometimes, to inquire?"
<p>"Certainly," replied Cissy, who liked him as much as she had despised the actor. Almost every one has antipathies. The actor was one of Cissy's, no doubt.
<p>Harry Hawthorne thanked her for her courtesy, paid for his gloves, and walked away with such a princely air that all the pretty salesgirls followed his exit with admiring eyes, and there was a swelling murmur of ejaculations:
<p>"Oh, what a handsome fellow!"
<p>"Isn't he perfectly magnif'?"
<p>"Who is he, Cissy? A Fifth avenue millionaire?"
<p>"Oh, no, indeed, girls; don't lose your wits! He's a fireman at the Ludlow street engine-house, that's all."
<p>"Oh, then he must be a prince in disguise; and, come to think of it, millionaires are not usually good-looking, any way. I might have known he was poor, from his beauty. He was talking to you about Jerry Harding, wasn't he? Is she his sweetheart?"
<p>"Perhaps so. Don't bother me! I don't know," laughed Cissy, cutting short their merry chatter.
<p>Meanwhile the object of their admiration hurried away and returned to the hospital.
<p>He had no trouble in finding the messenger-boy who had taken his note to Geraldine, and the youth, unconscious of having done wrong, very readily admitted that he had given the note to a gentleman, who said he was going in, and had offered to hand the letter to the lady.
<p>"No harm done, I hope, sir?" he said, regretfully.
<p>"Yes, more harm than you know. The man kept the letter, so the young lady never received it. It was something very important, too; and now she has gone away, and the mischief you did can never be undone."
<p>"Oh, my! what a pity!" exclaimed the boy, readily guessing that here was a broken-off love affair. He looked pityingly at Hawthorne a minute, then continued: "I'm very sorry I made such a mistake. I thought the fellow was a gentleman. But I know him, and I'll get even with him for that trick - you see if I don't!"
<p>"Who was he, Rob?"
<p>"Why, that Standish that plays in 'Hearts and Homes.' An elegant swell, don't you know? Gave me a quarter, like a lord. But I'll hunt him up, and get back that letter."
<p>"You are too late, Rob. He has gone on the road with his company."
<p>"Whew! And the lady gone, too, with him?"
<p>"Yes."
<p>"Oh, what a kettle of fish! Of my mixing, too! Indeed, Mr. Hawthorne, I'm sorry; and, if I ever get a chance, I'll do that fellow up for his treachery, the villain!" cried the boy, so earnestly that the listener could but smile, for he had no faith in the possibility of such an event taking place.
<p>He walked away, bitter at heart over the actor's treachery.
<p>"He kept that letter, and managed to make trouble between us somehow, the cunning wretch!" he mused, sadly enough, for the case looked hopeless now.
<p>Standish, having gained such a signal advantage over him in taking pretty Geraldine away, would follow it up by wedding her before his return.
<p>"If I could find out where she is on the road, I might still write and explain all," he thought, with a gleam of hope that quickly faded as he recalled the treacherous nature of his rival.
<p>"If I wrote to her, he would intercept my letter. He will be on the watch for that. There is no use trying and hoping. I have lost her forever - bonny, brown-eyed Geraldine!" he sighed, hopelessly.
<p>As he returned to his work at the engine-house, he felt as if he had just closed the coffin-lid over a well-beloved face.
<p>Such hopes and dreams as had come to him since he met fair Geraldine were hard to relinquish; they had brought such new brightness into his prosaic life; but he felt that all was over now.
<p>True, he felt that he had made a strong impression on the girl's heart, but his rival would soon teach her to forget that he had ever existed.
<p>But in a few days hope began unconsciously to reassert itself. He decided to call on Cecilia Carroll to inquire if she had any news.
<p>He went that evening, and she told him that Geraldine had not written yet.
<p>"But I found out from a manager the proposed route of the company, and I have written to her, and told her about you," she added, out of the kindness of her heart.
<p>"Clifford Standish will take good care that she never receives your letter," he said, bitterly, as he told her how the actor had intercepted the note he had sent to Geraldine.
<p>"I suspected as much, the grand villain!" cried Cissy, indignantly. "So now I shall write to her again and expose him!"
<p>She did so, but no answer came to either of her letters.
<p>Clifford Standish was too wily to permit Geraldine to receive them. He easily got possession of her mail, and destroyed it without a pang of remorse at his selfish heart.
<p>Yes, pretty Geraldine, piqued and unhappy over her cruel disappointment in love, had joined the Clemens Company, the manager of which was also one of the actors - Cameron Clemens. He played the clever villain in "Hearts and Homes," his special play, while Clifford Standish took the hero's part.
<p>Geraldine threw her whole heart into her work, and succeeded so well that she was promoted in a week, owing to the illness and withdrawal of the second lady from the company. It was the part of an ingenue, which just suited Geraldine's youth and naivette. She could act it to perfection without laying aside her pretty naturalness of manner.
<p>They traveled from town to town, staying just a night or two in each place, usually drawing full houses, and Geraldine proved a great attraction, winning always so much admiration that it was a wonder her pretty little head was not turned by flattery.
<p>It might have been had not her heart been so sore over its brief, broken love-dream.
<p>To have known a man but two brief, bright, happy days, and not be able to forget him, it was absurd, she thought, in desperate rebellion against her own heart.
<p>And yet, through the busy weeks of travel, study, and acting, Harry Hawthorne's image staid in her mind, and his voice rang through her dreams, sweet and low and tender as it had always been to her whenever he spoke.
<p>In her waking hours she knew him light and false; in her dreams he was always tender and true, and inexpressibly dear.
<p>Through all the changing days in which the silent struggle against a hopeless love went on in her young heart, Clifford Standish was ever near, patient, tender, devoted, telling her with his yearning eyes the love she was not ready to listen to yet.
<p>And in spite of herself, Geraldine found a subtle comfort in his devotion.
<p>It was a balm of healing to her proud heart, so deeply wounded by Harry Hawthorne's trifling.
<p>Many hearts have been caught in the rebound in this fashion, many true loves won.
<p>True, there are many proud ones who do not prize a love they can only have because it has been scornfully refused by another.
<p>They will say, resentfully:
<p>"I will not accept a love that is given me only because it was left by one who did not prize it."
<p>Others, more humble, will gladly accept the grateful love of a wounded heart that finds consolation in their tenderness.
<p>Clifford Standish, madly in love with Geraldine, was glad to accept such crumbs of love as might fall to him from the royal feast that had been spread for Harry Hawthorne.
<p>So he hovered by her side, he paid her the most delicate attentions, anticipating every wish, and found ample reward as he saw himself gaining in her grateful regard.
<p>At the same time the arch-traitor was intercepting the few letters that came to her, and the ones she wrote to Miss Carroll.
<p>For Geraldine had long ago gotten over her pet with her friend, since she know in her heart how dear she was to Cissy, and that the girl had advised her for her own good.
<p>Geraldine had found out that the career of an actress - even a young, pretty, and popular one - is not always strewn with roses.
<p>She had to study hard, and she did not enjoy traveling all day, or even half a day, and then appearing on the boards at night. Sometimes the hotel accommodations of country towns where they stopped over were wretchedly indifferent. Sometimes her head ached miserably, but she must appear on the boards, all the same. And the free-and-easy ways of some of the company did not please the fastidious taste of the girl.
<p>Now and then she found her thoughts returning to the old days behind the counter at O'Neill's with Cissy and the other girls, with an almost pathetic yearning. Secretly she longed to be back again.
<p>How she wished that Cissy would write to her now, and beg her to return, so that she might have an excuse for following the dictates of her heart.
<p>At last, believing that Cissy was too proud and stubborn to write first, she penned her a long, affectionate letter, through which breathed an underline of repentance and regret that her chum would be sure to answer it by writing:
<p>"Come home, dear. I told you that you would get sick of being an actress."
<p>But Geraldine was too weary and heart-sick to care for a hundred "I-told-you-so's" from the triumphant Cissy. What did it matter so that she got back to her dear old chum again and their cozy little rooms, and even to what she had once called her slavery behind the counter.
<p>She recalled what Harry Hawthorne had told her about it being a slavery of the stage, too; then put the thought from her with an impatient sigh.
<p>"What do I care what he said about it?" indignantly, then sighing, "even though I have found it to be, alas, too true!"
<p>She wrote her letter to Cissy, and after that her heart felt lighter. She knew her chum would be glad to get the letter - glad to have her back.
<p>Poor Geraldine! what a hopeless waiting she had for the letter that never came!
<p>How could he bear the wistful light in her sad brown eyes, the wretch who had robbed her young life of happiness?
<p>In his keeping rested the letters of the two fond girls to each other - the letters that would have brought happiness to three sad hearts.
<p>And the weeks slipped into months while they echoed in their souls the poet's plaint:
<p>It was two months now since they had gone upon the road, but not a word had Geraldine received. It seemed to her as if the past days were a dream, so different was her life now - all whirl, confusion, and excitement.
<p>Once she had thought this would be charming. Now she found it the reverse.
<p>How glad she was to hear that the company would go back to New York in time for Christmas. She was so tired of the West, where they had been all these weeks.
<p>When they were on their homeward way, they stopped over for a night at a pretty West Virginia town a few hundred miles from New York.
<p>They had come straight through from Chicago, and the stop-over was very agreeable to the weary members of the company.
<p>They arrived in the afternoon, and the tired travelers, after resting a while at their romantic hotel on the banks of the beautiful Greenbrier River, set out to explore the little town of Alderson, first hurrying to the post-office for their letters, which they expected to be awaiting them there.
<p>Geraldine did not expect any mail, poor girl! She waited at the door while Clifford Standish went in and came out with a little budget for himself.
<p>"Nothing for you, Geraldine. It seems that Miss Carroll is still unforgiving," he laughed, without noting the sensitive quiver of her scarlet lips.
<p>They walked on, and she pretended to be absorbed in contemplation of the beautiful mountain scenery, while he ran over his letters.
<p>"Let us cross the railroad and walk on the bridge over there," she said, at last.
<p>It was a beautiful sunny day, very calm and mild for December. They loitered on the broad bridge that spanned the romantic river between the two towns, Alderson and North Alderson, and while she watched the lapsing river and the mountain peaks against the clear blue sky, he read to her bits of his letters from New York.
<p>"Here's one that will interest you," he laughed, meaningly, and read:
<p>"'Well, old fellow, there's nothing that I know in the way of interesting news just now, unless that a girl you used to be sweet on is going to be married to-morrow. It's little Daisy Odell, you know, of Newburgh. She's been visiting a married sister here, and caught a beau. He's a fireman named Harry Hawthorne, a big, handsome fellow, the hero of several fires. The marriage will take place at Mrs. Stansbury's, and I've an invitation to it.'"
<p>He looked from the letter to her face, and saw that she was deadly pale and grief-stricken.
<p>"Oh, will you let me read that for myself?" she gasped, as if she could scarcely believe him.
<p>"Why, certainly," he answered, but as he was handing her the crumpled sheet, the wind caught it somehow, and fluttered it beyond reach over the rail and down into the river.
<p>"Oh! oh! oh!" he cried, with pretended dismay, but his outstretched hand could not grasp it.
<p>"It's gone; but no matter - the news must be true, for Charlie Butler wrote it, and he always tells the truth," he said, carelessly.
<p>And how was the unsuspecting girl to know that no such words were written in the letter, and that it was from a woman, instead of Charlie Butler?
<p>Geraldine was proud, very proud - and she thought she had quite overcome her hopeless love for Harry Hawthorne.
<p>But the sudden, unexpected news of his marriage, that she never thought of doubting, struck her with the suddenness of an awful blow, beating down pride and reserve at one terrible stroke.
<p>She realized all at once that her heart had still kept alive a little fire of hope burning before the shrine of its unacknowledged love. The quenching of this spark of hope was almost like the going out of life itself.
<p>The other members of the party had gone on to the other side of the bridge and she was alone with Clifford Standish - alone with the agony of soul that blanched her sweet face to death-like pallor, and made her clutch at the rails, gasping out that she was ill, dying.
<p>The arch-villain caught her swaying form and held it tenderly in his arms, while her white, unconscious face rested against his shoulder.
<p>Some country people walking over the bridge at that moment stared in amazement, and going on to town, reported that, "those actor-folks were carrying on dreadful on the bridge - hugging right before folks."
<p>But neither of the two participants was troubled over this sensation, Geraldine being unconscious, and Standish too much absorbed in her to heed aught else.
<p>In a minute or two she sighed and opened her eyes.
<p>"Oh!" she cried, as she met his eyes gazing deep into hers, and tried to struggle from his clasp.
<p>"Wait. You cannot stand alone yet," he said, tenderly, then murmured: "Oh, Geraldine, it breaks my heart to find that you loved him, that low fireman, so unworthy of you; while I - I - have worshiped you ever since the hour I first saw you behind the counter, so bright and beautiful. I have been trying to win you ever since, and hoped - vainly hoped, as I see now - that I was succeeding. Oh, how did he succeed - this man you saw but a few hours - in winning your love?"
<p>She struggled from his clasp, her strength returning, her face hot with blushes of fierce shame.
<p>"It - it - is not true that I love him - no, no, no!" she faltered, wildly.
<p>"But, my dearest girl, you fainted when you heard of his marriage."
<p>"Oh, no, it was not that. I was tired, ill - from traveling, you know," cried poor Geraldine, who would have died rather than admit the truth which her pale, pale cheeks and trembling lips told all too plainly by their mute despair.
<p>But her denial suited the actor's purpose, and he cried, gladly:
<p>"Oh, I am so happy to hear you say you did not care for him. I feared - feared - that your kindness to me, your sweet smiles and ready acceptance of my attentions were only cruel coquetry."
<p>"Oh, no, no," she murmured, helplessly, feeling herself drawn to him by every word he said.
<p>Had she given him cause, then, to believe she meant to accept him?
<p>He caught her hand, and continued, fondly, eagerly:
<p>"Oh, Geraldine, dare I hope you care for me after all? That you will let me love you, and you love me a little in return? Will you - be my wife?"
<p>He saw her shudder as with a mortal chill; then pride came to her aid. She let him keep the hand he had taken, and she answered, faintly:
<p>"Yes."
<p>And then a great horror of what she had promised rushed over her. How could she be his wife when she did not love him? Such a marriage would be sacrilege!
<p>Her head drooped heavily, and her eyes were half-closed as she listened despairingly to the words of grateful joy he poured out. Not one of them found an echo in her heart.
<p>Until now she had been grateful to him for his kindness, but a sudden aversion took root in her heart now, and she felt that she would rather die than be his wife.
<p>But, to save her life, she could not have opened her lips to take back her promise.
<p>She knew how angry he would be, how he would accuse her of trifling and coquetry. She could not bring down on herself the weight of his wrath.
<p>But to the day of her death Geraldine would never forget that hour on the bridge at Alderson - that hour into whose short compass were crowded so much pain and regret that she longed for death to end her misery.
<p>Mechanically she heard the whistle of an approaching train coming over the track at the end of the bridge. The rumble and roar blent with the rush of the river in her ears as she said, wearily:
<p>"Let us return to the hotel. I - am - so - tired!"
<p>Alas, poor girl! it was a tired heart!
<p>They walked back toward the railroad, and the train came rushing on with a thunderous roar.
<p>There was not one thought of suicide in her mind - she had always thought it a weak and cowardly act - but somehow a mad longing for death - because life was so bitter - seized on unhappy Geraldine.
<p>The train was so close that they must wait for it to pass before they could cross.
<p>She darted suddenly from the side of Standish and threw herself face downward across the trembling rails.
<p>Harry Hawthorne called on Miss Carroll several times, but she always had the same discouraging story to tell - no answer from Geraldine to the letters she had written.
<p>He gave up going at last, and tried to resign himself to his cruel disappointment.
<p>"If she ever cared for me in the least, that villain Standish with his infernal arts, has turned her against me forever. But let him look out for himself if he ever returns to New York. We shall have a reckoning then, over my letter to Geraldine that he intercepted," he said to himself, bitterly and often.
<p>Those were dreary days to the young fireman after he came out of the hospital and found Geraldine gone. People had always called him cold and unsocial somehow, and he became more reticent than ever now, going nowhere at all except when Captain Stansbury fairly dragged him to the house.
<p>Mrs. Stansbury, as soon as she returned from Newburgh, had been anxious to renew her acquaintance with Geraldine, but meeting Standish on the street one day and asking after her, she was told that the young girl had lost her position at O'Neill's because of her trip to Newburgh and had gone back to her country home in consequence.
<p>"Oh, I am so sorry, for I wished to cultivate her acquaintance, she was such a lovely girl!" the good-natured young woman said, regretfully:
<p>"Yes, very pretty, but a shocking flirt! I got acquainted with her on the street by a handkerchief flirtation," laughed the actor, and he saw that the leaven worked. Mrs. Stansbury did not approve of forward girls, and her eagerness to see more of pretty Geraldine was at once abated.
<p>She knew no better until weeks later, when her husband brought Hawthorne home for dinner, and discussing the pleasant times they had had at Newburgh, he told her of Geraldine's going on the stage with Standish.
<p>Little by little all came out, and she exclaimed:
<p>"Mr. Standish must have lied to me in saying that she had lost her place and gone home to the country, and that he made her acquaintance by a street flirtation."
<p>"It was cruelly false," answered Hawthorne, who had heard from Cissy the whole story of the beginning of the acquaintance of the wily actor and the pretty shop-girl. He continued:
<p>"He wished to prevent your further association with Geraldine, so as to keep her away from me."
<p>"And he really intercepted your letter to her? I did not dream he was such a villain."
<p>"He shall answer to me for that injury when we meet again," he said, so sternly that she saw that he was in bitter earnest.
<p>She admired him for his manly resentment, and said, cordially:
<p>"I do not blame you for wishing to punish him. Any manly man would do likewise. As for Geraldine, when she learns of his perfidy, she will turn from him in disgust."
<p>"Unless she has learned to love the villain. Women are so faithful in their love even when the object is unworthy," he sighed.
<p>Changing the subject, she continued:
<p>"Do you know that Sister Daisy is to be married the week before Christmas?"
<p>"Your husband told me."
<p>"Yes? Well, the bridal party are to spend Christmas with me. The other girls - Carrie and Consuelo - are coming, too. I intend to have a theatre party on Christmas Eve - a box to ourselves - and I want you to join us, won't you? And bring some pretty girl with you, for my sisters will have their beaus."
<p>"I don't know any girl," he began, then suddenly remembered pretty Cissy Carroll.
<p>"Oh, yes, I'll join the party if I can get leave. And there's a girl I know - Miss Carroll - the very intimate friend of pretty Geraldine. I'll bring her, if she will accept an invitation."
<p>"Very well, and you may take me to call on her in the meanwhile, and then I can ask her to the dance I'm going to give the girls," replied amiable Mrs. Stansbury.
<p>And so it was arranged that Cissy made the acquaintance of the Stansbury clique, and fell in love with them as deeply as Geraldine had done.
<p>And on Christmas Eve they all filled a box at the theatre - and a merry party they were, for even Harry Hawthorne unbent from the grave reserve that was habitual to him of late, and tried to make himself entertaining to gentle Cissy while the orchestra played and they waited for the first act.
<p>"What is the play?" asked Hawthorne, for Captain Stansbury had secured the tickets, and reserved the name of the piece as a surprise to the party.
<p>"It's 'Laurel Vane' - a society play, by a well-known author - and it is to be presented for the first time to-night," replied Captain Stansbury.
<p>"I hope it is a good company," said his wife.
<p>"Oh, yes - excellent. The Clemens Company. I know the manager well."
<p>There was a start from all, and Mrs. Stansbury said, nervously:
<p>"But I thought that company was on the road."
<p>"They returned to New York yesterday, with this new play," replied the captain, who was not in the secret of Clifford Standish's villainy.
<p>The orchestra stopped playing, and the curtain rose.
<p>Mrs. Alex. McVeigh Miller.
<p>Poor, pretty Geraldine, if she had ever thought of death at all, she had never dreamed of ending her life like this beneath the wheels of this great panting, shrieking iron monster, rushing down upon her as her beautiful form lay across the bright steel rails where she had thrown herself in the extremity of despair!
<p>But, frantic with hopeless love and terror at the promise she had just given - the reckless promise of her hand without the heart - reason had momentarily deserted its throne, and, conscious only of a mad desire to escape from life's tragedies of woe, she rushed forward in front of the train, and laid her golden head down upon the pillow of death, like one lying down to pleasant dreams.
<p>And although her suicidal act was seen by fifty pairs of eyes, it was too late for even the most heroic hand to snatch her from her impending doom.
<p>The locomotive was so close upon her the moment she fell before it that the immense cow-catcher touched her, and - even as the horrified shriek of Standish rang upon the wintry air - it seemed to draw her beneath the horrible grinding machine!
<p>Did Heaven, in pity and mercy, intervene to save the rash girl from the consequences of her mad attempt at self-destruction?
<p>Not once in a hundred cases is a human life saved by being caught and thrown upward by the projecting cow-catcher in front of the monster locomotive.
<p>Yet once in a while such a fortunate intervention occurs, and a fatal disaster is prevented.
<p>To poor, reckless Geraldine, who had placed herself beyond the reach of human aid, this accident happened, or our story must have ended here with the tragic close of her short life.
<p>It almost seemed as if invisible angels must have caught up her doomed form from the track and placed it on the great shovel-like projection in safety, so miraculous seemed the saving of her life.
<p>And a moment later the train, which had been slowing up as it entered the town, came to a full stop at the station, and the horrified engineer, who had been utterly unable to prevent what had seemed to happen, saw Geraldine's form lying on the platform of the cow-catcher, where it had rebounded at the first touch, and a cry of thanksgiving rose from his throat, echoed by a hundred other voices of those who had seen it all, and who now rushed to the spot in wild haste.
<p>Quiet little Alderson had a sensation that day never to be forgotten in after years, when the express train rushed into the station bearing on its very front that form of a beautiful girl driven wild by sorrow, until she had tried to end her life in this terrible fashion.
<p>What kind and eager hands drew her from her perilous position; what sympathetic eyes gazed on her beautiful white face as they laid her down on the platform, quite unconscious, for she had swooned when she threw herself on the track.
<p>Every doctor in town was speedily on the scene. They vied with each other in their efforts to restore her to consciousness.
<p>And in a few minutes Geraldine opened her heavy-lidded eyes with a blank gaze, and saw herself surrounded by a sympathetic, though curious crowd, and, as in a dream, heard Clifford Standish eagerly explaining to the people:
<p>"Oh, no, indeed; you are mistaken. It was not an attempt at suicide; it was only a fool-hardy attempt to cross the track before the engine. She declared that she could do it safely, and dared me to follow her, darting from my side before I could restrain her, for I would not have permitted the rash venture otherwise. Still, I believe she would have accomplished the feat and cleared the track by a hair's breadth, only that her foot slipped and threw her down at that fatal moment."
<p>Bending down to Geraldine's ear, he whispered, warningly:
<p>"Do not contradict what I have told them, or they may put you in prison for attempted suicide, as they do in New York."
<p>The people thought he was her lover, whispering to her of his joy at her safety, and in a moment he confirmed the belief by saying aloud:
<p>"She would be distressed if any one accused her of trying to kill herself, for she is one of the happiest girls in the world. In fact, while we were standing on the bridge she had promised to marry me."
<p>"Yes, I say him hugging her on the bridge, myself," said the old countryman who had passed them, and a smile went around, and then a cheer for the fair young life saved for a happy wedded future.
<p>They carried her to the hotel that was but a few yards away, and it was found that she had sustained some bruises on her side, that was all. She would be able to go on with the company.
<p>And a great revulsion of feeling took place in her mind - joy that her life was spared, horror at the momentary insanity that had driven her to that awful deed. Life grew sweet again, in spite of her great sorrow.
<p>When the sympathetic women left her alone that evening in her room, she knelt down in a passion of repentance, and prayed God to forgive her for her great sin in trying to throw away the life He had given.
<p>And she prayed Heaven to help her to forget Harry Hawthorne, and to love Clifford Standish, the man she had promised to marry.
<p>"Surely he is good and true, and deserves my love," she thought, in an impulse of gratitude to him for the way he had shielded her when the people talked of suicide. She was ashamed of the truth now - glad for them to think it had been an accident.
<p>"I will never be so foolish and so wicked again," she thought, in her keen remorse for her sin.
<p>She spent a wakeful, restless night in spite of the sedatives the kind Doctor Spicer had administered before he went away. The hotel was so close to the railroad that she could hear the trains thundering by all night long, and the sound made her shudder with terror at thought of the heavy iron wheels that had come so near to crushing out her fair young life.
<p>She was glad when morning came, and they boarded the train for New York.
<p>She was eager to get away from this place, yet she would never forget Alderson, with its beautiful mountains, its romantic, winding river, and the bridge where she had stood with Standish, listening to the cruel words that had extinguished the last spark of hope in her breast and driven her mad with despair.
<p>No, she would never forget beautiful Alderson, on the rippling, winding, singing Greenbrier River, set like an emerald chain between its romantic banks, overshadowed by wooded mountains, but she would remember it always with a horror it did not deserve, poor Geraldine, because of its tragic associations.
<p>We must return to our description of the scene in the theatre when the curtain rose on the first act, and the eager eyes of the large audience turned upon the stage.
<p>The heroine of the play, Laurel Vane, a beautiful girl, left penniless and alone by the death of her only surviving parent, was discovered weeping in the shabby room from which she would soon be turned out, because she had no money to pay her rent.
<p>Enter the handsome villain, Ross Powell, who declares his love for Laurel, and makes wicked proposals.
<p>Repulsed with scorn, he departs, vowing vengeance on the scornful little beauty.
<p>Desperate with misery, Laurel seeks a beautiful young lady, the noble daughter of a publisher, for whose magazine her father had written until his death.
<p>"She is a sister-woman, and will help me in my trouble," thought the poor girl.
<p>Between this splendid Miss Gordon and her clever maid, a plan was formed by which the orphan girl by sailing under false colors became the honored guest of wealthy people, and afterward the bride of a proud aristocrat, who thought he had married the peerless Miss Gordon, and had never heard of poor little Laurel Vane, who was his worshiped wife.
<p>Upon this conspiracy hung all the plot of the play, and the leading parts were taken, first by Clifford Standish, leading man, the part of the hero, St. Leon Le Roy; the part of the heroine, Laurel Vane, by Geraldine Harding; the villain, Ross Powell, by Cameron Clemens; and Miss Gordon by Madeline Mills, the usual star of the company, although she had yielded precedence in this case to Geraldine, who looked so exactly the part of the ingenue heroine, with her starry brown eyes and curly golden hair.
<p>But it is not necessary to our story to go into the details of the play. Although it enthralled the attention of the sympathetic audience, it held even greater interest for the party in the Stansbury box, because they knew two of the actors so well.
<p>How it thrilled Harry Hawthorne to see pretty Geraldine again, even though he deprecated her stage career so bitterly.
<p>As for Cissy, the tears sprang to her eyes when she first saw her lost friend, looking so familiar in the same simple black serge gown she had worn behind the counter when she was only a salesgirl at O'Neill's great store, and which answered excellently well for the mourning gown of the orphan heroine. Indeed, that floating mass of golden locks was glory enough to lend beauty to the shabbiest attire.
<p>They watched her with absorbing interest through the changes of the play, but for a long time Geraldine did not perceive them. She was absorbed in her work, and did not cast coquettish glances at the boxes, like the other actresses. It was well she did not, for the sight of them would have unnerved her cruelly.
<p>But Clifford Standish was on the alert, and while posing as the magnificent Le Roy, scowled secretly at the occupants of that particular box.
<p>When the first act was over, he intercepted Geraldine on her way to the dressing-room, and said:
<p>"I have something very particular to tell you.
<p>"Yes."
<p>"Now call your pride to your aid, dear one, for you will be shocked, I know. But I thought it best to put you on your guard."
<p>"Yes," she answered, paling suddenly, but with her small head proudly erect.
<p>"Have you noticed the first box to the right?"
<p>"No, I have not looked at the house at all. I heard it was crowded," wearily.
<p>"It is, and we have made a hit. But - that box - there's a theatre party in it - all people that you know."
<p>"Indeed," listlessly, pretending no interest.
<p>"Yes, and I tell you about them now so you will not notice them when you go on again in the second part. They are the Stansburys; the bride and groom, Harry and Mrs. Hawthorne; the two single Odell girls, and Cissy Carroll, with three young men - their beaus, no doubt."
<p>She clutched his arm with a trembling hand.
<p>"I - I - wish you had not told me," she faltered. "I - shall - be nervous now - in my part, I fear."
<p>"You do not mean that you can care for that fellow still - you, my promised bride, and he the husband of Daisy Odell?" reproachfully.
<p>"Oh, no, no; do not accuse me of such weakness," wildly. "But there is - Cissy, you know - Cissy turned against me, and we were so fond once!"
<p>Her voice was almost a wail.
<p>"Do not think of her, my dearest love - she is not worthy of it, the jealous, envious creature! Call pride to help you appear indifferent. Do not even turn your head toward that box, and they need never know how they have wounded your fond heart," he persisted, anxiously.
<p>"Yes, yes; I will obey you," she answered, faintly.
<p>"And, Geraldine, my darling - my sweet, promised bride - you know how madly I love you, but you have denied all my prayers for an immediate marriage! Will you not relent and make me the happiest man on earth? Oh, let us be married to-night after the play! It can be managed easily enough. Say yes, dearest?"
<p>A call-boy came through the corridor, chanting:
<p>"Only five minutes till next act - only five minutes."
<p>She broke away from him, panting, breathlessly:
<p>"I cannot answer you now."
<p>She fled to her dressing-room, glad to escape his importunities, yet feeling as if she did not do him justice by her lack of love.
<p>"He is so patient, so tender, and so eager to spare me pain, that I ought to love him more than I do," she told herself.
<p>Respect and esteem she could give him, for she believed that he was good and noble, so well had he acted the traitor's part; but love - oh, we cannot give love at will!
<p>She stole to the wings one moment, to gaze by stealth at the theatre party, and by the merest accident Harry Hawthorne was leaning over the bride's chair, talking to her of some trifle, but the sight made Geraldine draw back all white and quivering, with a cruel pang at her heart.
<p>"I hate him!" she moaned, to herself, in a passion of jealous despair.
<p>But when she came upon the stage she did not look again at the box, or she would have seen that Harry Hawthorne sat apart from Daisy, by the side of Cissy. She acted her part well, for in it there was much of the tragic pain that suited well with her desperate mood.
<p>At the close of the second act, Standish renewed his pleadings for a marriage that night, and in her bitter mood, Geraldine, like many others who exchange one pain for another in mad impatience, ceased to struggle against his importunities and yielded a passive consent to his ardent prayer.
<p>Yes, she had promised to marry Clifford Standish as soon as the last act of the play was over. The act would leave the heroine, Laurel, presumably "happy ever after" but must plunge poor Geraldine into deeper despair.
<p>For though she admired Clifford Standish greatly, was proud of his love, and grateful for his kindness, she did not feel as if she could ever love him as she had loved another. Her poor heart seemed dead and cold in its numb misery of slighted love, and the thought of marriage was repugnant to every instinct of her nature.
<p>But she owed Clifford Standish such a debt of gratitude that there seemed no way of paying it save by yielding to his importunate entreaties for an immediate marriage.
<p>But how she shrank from the moment that would seal her fate, although she had failed in courage to defend herself from it.
<p>It was a bitter pride that was pushing her into this unloving marriage.
<p>She would let Harry Hawthorne, who had flirted with her so cruelly, see that she did not care for him at all; that she could marry a man who was his superior in position, in riches, and in everything that made up true and noble manhood.
<p>Geraldine despised a male flirt. Whenever one of the creatures tried to catch her eyes in public, she always set him down beneath contempt, and one withering glance from her flashing eyes would make him shrink into himself, ashamed for once before the scornful eyes of a true woman.
<p>And the thought that Harry Hawthorne was one of those contemptible wretches was inexpressibly bitter.
<p>She had shed many secret tears over the dread that he had read in her frank brown eyes the tenderness he had awakened in her heart.
<p>She thought when she was married to the actor, and Hawthorne heard of it, he would think she had only been flirting with him at Newburgh, and that she had been engaged to Standish all the while. In this fancy there was a kind of balm for her aching heart.
<p>She could hardly keep the tears back from her eyes as she thought it over and over, wondering if, after all, Harry Hawthorne had not cared for her a wee bit, but had been bound to Daisy Odell beforehand.
<p>She wondered if she should ever meet him again, after she was married, and if it would give him pain to know if she belonged to another man.
<p>To save her life, Geraldine could not help half-believing in the ardent love that had looked at her out of those dark-blue eyes, and if she would but have looked up at the box where he sat, she would have seen that love shining on her still - a love as strong as death, although it was so hopeless.
<p>But Geraldine did not look that way, tutored to proud indifference by the cunning arts of Standish. She seemed cold as ice, but her heart was burning with restless longings for her lost love-dream.
<p>"Perhaps he may repent and love me some day when it is too late - too late!" she sighed, bitterly, thinking of the sweet
<p>Poor Geraldine wished that the hands of time could turn back and delay the moment of her marriage, now so speedily approaching.
<p>But the second act was over, the third and last began.
<p>She was so nervous, it was the greatest wonder in the world that she did not forget her lines, and call down the ridicule of the audience. But she threw herself with abandon into the part. It was so tragic she could feel every word of it.
<p>And so the end came.
<p>It was the moment before the curtain fell, when the whole company were grouped upon the stage in the final tableau, that - a startling interruption occurred.
<p>A deputy sheriff, with his aids, strode upon the stage, and clapped his hand on the shoulder of Clifford Standish.
<p>"You are my prisoner!" he said, sternly; and added: "I have a warrant for your arrest for deserting your wife."
<p>It was like a thunder-clap, so sudden and so startling.
<p>The actor, at that moment, was holding Geraldine's hand in a fervent clasp, and he felt it turn cold as ice as she drew it from him in trembling horror.
<p>He grew lividly pale beneath his stage make-up, but he tried to brazen it out by saying:
<p>"Officer, you have made a mistake. I am not the man."
<p>"Oh, yes, you are, Clifford Standish, and you must come with me to the Tombs at once," returned the deputy sheriff, with a satirical smile.
<p>"I tell you it is a mistake; I have no wife, and this is a base attempt to injure an innocent man. I will prove it in court to-morrow," exclaimed the actor, putting on an air of injured innocence.
<p>The audience was in an uproar, cries of sympathy and jeers of execration blending together. The accusation of the deputy sheriff had been heard by all. Mrs. Stansbury's box party looked and listened with breathless interest, and Cissy whispered to Hawthorne.
<p>"Oh, the grand villain! trying to brazen it out! but I am sure that he is guilty. And poor Geraldine, how white and stricken she looks. I'm going down to her to persuade her to come home with me to-night."
<p>"You must come with me," repeated the deputy sheriff, sternly, to Standish, and he answered, sullenly:
<p>"Very well; but first let me speak to Miss Harding."
<p>And while they guarded him closely, he whispered to the dazed and shrinking girl:
<p>"For God's sake, do not believe the falsehood that has been trumped up against me by some enemy just to injure me in your regards. It is not true, and if you will only believe in me till to-morrow, I will prove it."
<p>"I - I - will try to trust in you," she faltered, gently, but in her heart she knew that she was glad of this interruption to her wedding - knew that she hoped the charge was true.
<p>If he had a wife already, he would be proved a villain, and she - Geraldine - would be free of the promise so rashly made.
<p>"One more promise, my angel! Do not have anything to say to - to - my enemies in the box. They will try to turn your heart against me," he pleaded, feverishly.
<p>"Come, come! I cannot wait any longer," the deputy sheriff said, roughly, and pulled him away before she could reply.
<p>And the next moment Cissy's soft hand clasped hers, and her gentle voice said:
<p>"Let us be friends again, dear Geraldine."
<p>"Oh, Cissy, darling," and the pretty actress, whom all had been praising for her genius, fell into the other's arms, sobbing like a weary child.
<p>"You poor, dear child!" cooed Cissy, patting the golden head. Then - "You'll come home with me for to-night, dear, won't you? I have a cab waiting."
<p>Geraldine was only too glad to go. She hurried her friend to the dressing-room to wait while she got ready.
<p>Cissy chatted incessantly:
<p>"You didn't see us all, so grand in that box to-night, did you? I tried to catch your eye, but you never looked once! And poor Harry Hawthorne, how disappointed he was at your indifference!"
<p>"Cissy!" and the pretty actress stamped her tiny foot angrily.
<p>"Good gracious! What is the matter, my dear?"
<p>"Never mention that man to me again! I hate him!"
<p>"Who - Clifford Standish? I don't blame you! I've hated him ever since he first became known to me."
<p>"No, no; I mean Harry Hawthorne!"
<p>"Why, what has he done to you, Geraldine?"
<p>"Has - hasn't he - gone and married Daisy Odell?" with a stifled sob.
<p>Cissy Carroll made big eyes of surprise at Geraldine's charge.
<p>"Married Daisy Odell? Harry Hawthorne? Why, certainly not! Whatever put such an idea into your dear little noddle?" she demanded, in wonder.
<p>"Mr. Standish told me so before we came back to New York. He said he had an invitation to the wedding. And isn't Daisy married to him, after all? Oh, Cissy, don't try to deceive me, for I saw her - saw her in the box all in white - so bride-like - and Harry Hawthorne leaning over her chair," exclaimed Geraldine, clutching the other's arm with unconscious violence, her beautiful eyes dilated with doubt and entreaty.
<p>"My darling Gerry, don't pinch me black and blue, please, and don't get so excited. Yes, Daisy Odell is certainly married."
<p>"Oh-h-h!" groaned Geraldine, in anguish.
<p>"She is married," pursued Cissy, "and married to one of the dearest fellows in the world, she says - Charlie Butler - but not to Harry Hawthorne. Why, I don't believe he wants to marry any one in the world but you!"
<p>"Me - Cissy!" and Geraldine's face, so lugubrious a moment before, grew radiant with joy, while the girl continued:
<p>"That wretch, Clifford Standish, has told you falsehoods about Mr. Hawthorne, dear, for he never thought of loving any one but you. Didn't you see him with me in the box to-night? I am the only girl he ever goes with, and that is just for your sake, dear, because I was your friend."
<p>"Oh, Cissy!"
<p>Such joy as there was in those two words, for new life came to Geraldine in the assurance that Hawthorne was free, and loved her still.
<p>She put on her dress with trembling fingers, crying:
<p>"Oh, help me, Cissy, I'm so nervous - and - and tired, you know."
<p>"Poor child! no wonder. And troubled, too, perhaps, for maybe you - loved that Standish!"
<p>"Oh, no, no - never, Cissy!"
<p>"Oh, I'm so glad, for that would have broken poor Hawthorne's tender heart, he loves you so much. And you, dear - didn't you care for him a little, too?"
<p>Geraldine was all blushing, blissful confusion.
<p>"I - I - you know how that was, Cissy. I liked him - just a little - at first, but when he did not come that night, or after" - she broke down, sobbing under her breath.
<p>"Oh, Geraldine, he could not - he was hurt you know - and Standish intercepted his letter of explanation. But I mustn't rattle on like this, or I'll leave nothing for Hawthorne to tell you himself."
<p>Geraldine looked at her with a glorified face.
<p>"Oh, Cissy! Shall I see him soon?"
<p>"He's waiting at the cab, dear, so let us hurry."
<p>She fastened the ribbons of Geraldine's cape, and, taking her hand, hurried her through the corridor to the stage door.
<p>And there - oh, joy of joys! stood Harry Hawthorne, waiting, with an eager, expectant look.
<p>How Geraldine's heart bounded at the sight of that handsome face!
<p>She could scarcely restrain herself from springing into his arms.
<p>But, instead, she demurely held out her little hand, and he clasped it closely, saying as he led her to the cab:
<p>"I am so glad to find you again, and we must have a long talk to-night."
<p>It was a long distance from the theatre to Cissy's home, but the distance was short to Geraldine and her lover, as they sat side by side in the cab, almost wishing that the ride would never come to an end, it was so heavenly sweet to be together again.
<p>Both of them were in secret ecstasies at the catastrophe to Clifford Standish that had seemed to remove him from their path forever.
<p>The future seemed to stretch before them roseate, shining, love-crowned, blissful.
<p>Cissy did her best to explain away all the shadows that had come between them all.
<p>"Geraldine, I wrote you five letters. Why didn't you answer them, you cruel girl?"
<p>"Five letters? Oh, Cissy, I never received one of them; and it almost broke my heart that you would not answer all the long ones I wrote to you."
<p>"You wrote to me? How strange that I did not get a line from you, dear. And I was so grieved, so uneasy over you. I thought you were proud and stubborn. But, tell me - did you post them yourself?"
<p>"No; I always gave them to Mr. Standish to send out with the company's mail."
<p>"Ah! that accounts for all. The wretch intercepted our letters to each other, just as he did Mr. Hawthorne's letters to you."
<p>"I do not understand," said Geraldine; so they told her the story of the actor's treachery.
<p>Everything lay bare before her now, and she comprehended that all she had suffered since her parting with Harry Hawthorne had been brought about by a deep-laid plot, involving both her happiness and honor; for what if she had married Standish to-night - he, who already had a wife, whom he had deserted!
<p>Her honor would have been trampled in the dust; her life wrecked, to gratify the base passion of this monster, whom she had mistakenly believed the embodiment of truth and goodness.
<p>Trembling with horror at all that she had so narrowly escaped, Geraldine bowed her head in her hands and sobbed aloud.
<p>And Harry Hawthorne longed to take her in his arms and comfort her, but he did not have the right yet, for only words of friendship had been spoken between them, and he feared and dreaded that she had given her young heart to the wretch who had succeeded so well in his vile plans for parting them in the first flush of their sweet love-dream.
<p>But now they were at home, and, bidding the cabman wait, he went in with the girls, saying:
<p>"I know it is rather late to make a call, but something impels me to have a talk with Miss Harding to-night, if she will permit me."
<p>She gave a glad assent, seconded by Cissy, who said, cordially:
<p>"Yes, indeed, come in and talk to Geraldine. You are very excusable under the circumstances."
<p>And, lighting up the poor, but neat, little room, she left them and retired to the adjoining one, where she busied herself with little preparations for the morrow, so as not to embarrass the lovers by her presence.
<p>As for them, when they were left alone, Hawthorne, still standing, took Geraldine's hand and drew her to him, gazing into her face with tender, questioning blue eyes.
<p>The answering look in her sweet tearful eyes was so satisfactory that he said:
<p>"I think everything is explained between us now, is it not, Geraldine? You must have known before we parted that fatal day that I loved you!"
<p>She could not speak because of the happy sob in her throat, but her burning blushes seemed to answer yes, and he pressed her little hand tighter as he continued:
<p>"Yes, even in the brief time I knew you, dearest, you had become the one love of my life, treasured in my heart as the most rare and radiant thing under heaven. And I - I - fancied I read in your sweet smiles that my love would not be given in vain - that I should win you for my own!"
<p>It was like the sweetest music in her ears to hear him telling his love so ardently, with that eager look in his eyes, and such a quiver of hope and fear in his musical voice. It was so dear, so sweet, so thrilling, Geraldine could have listened unweariedly forever.
<p>Oh, first love! what a glimpse through the open gates of heaven it is to the youthful heart! Nothing that comes after, even in the longest life, can compare with it in bliss.
<p>It clothes the world in new beauty, makes the sky more blue, the flowers more fair, the sunlight more golden.
<p>And, thank Heaven, it can gladden the hearts of the poor and humble as well as the rich and great. None are so poor that beautiful Love refuses to visit them, or abide in their hearts.
<p>So to this pair of lovers, though their lot in life was but lowly, and the roof that sheltered them humble, came as pure and rich a joy as if they had dwelt in palace halls. Is it not a glorious provision of Providence that love is free for all? Not bought like diamonds, although it shines brighter; not purchased like luxuries, although it is sweeter, but free as the pure air of heaven, although the greatest luxury, so that if it had to be bought it would bring the greatest price of all.
<p>"Oh, Geraldine," cried her lover, "I love you still, I shall love you always, even if my love prove hopeless, and changes from bliss to endless pain! But give me some little hope to feed on, dearest one. Tell me that that base wretch Standish did not win you with his wicked arts, did not turn your heart against me!"
<p>"Oh, no, no, no!" she murmured, faintly, then paused, abashed, remembering how she had listened to and believed all the cruel falsehoods against her true lover.
<p>"You believed in me, in spite of all! Oh, how can I thank you - - " he began, but she interrupted.
<p>"Oh, no, I was not so noble as you believe, for I thought he told the truth. But - but - it made me wretched, thinking you were what he said, for - I could not love him, though he begged me. I - I - loved you, in spite of all!"
<p>"Geraldine - my own!" and he caught her to his breast, their lips meeting in Love's first kiss.
<p>Oh, the happiness of that moment; its never-to-be-forgotten bliss! It paid for all they had suffered in the months that they had been so cruelly parted by the machinations of a villain.
<p>At last they thought of sitting down, although Hawthorne said, happily:
<p>"But it must be for only a moment; then I must tear myself away, and not keep you from your needful rest, my beloved one. To-morrow I will come again, and feast my eyes on the sight of you."
<p>"Oh, it is not so late, and - I am not sleepy," she faltered.
<p>"Darling!" and he kissed the sweet lips fondly again; then, holding her hand, and looking deep in her tender eyes, he continued: "I am going to ask you for one pledge of the love you have so sweetly confessed for me, Geraldine. Promise me that you will never go on the stage again."
<p>"Oh, never, never! I hate it now, and I will never tread the boards again!" vowed Geraldine, in eager earnest, shuddering at thought of the pitfalls Clifford Standish had spread for her unwary feet, and thanking Heaven in her secret heart that she had escaped them.
<p>She could not bring herself to confess to her lover that she had actually promised to marry Standish that night, and that only a fortunate accident had prevented the consummation of the horror. Why, even now, instead of this dear hand-clasp, instead of these dear kisses, she might have been trembling in silent disgust at the caresses of a man she could never love! Oh, how good Heaven had been to save her from the consequences of her own folly, and restore her to her love again!
<p>She resolved never to tell Hawthorne of that broken engagement. She felt that she could almost die of shame to have him find it out.
<p>"I must keep that secret from him, and I must never tell him, either, that I tried to throw away my life when I thought him married to another. I should not like him to know quite how fondly I love him!" she thought, with sensitive maiden pride.
<p>Then Hawthorne had to tear himself away.
<p>"To-morrow is Christmas, and I shall try to spend it with you," he said, fondly. "But I may be kept from your side by a fire, for there are always so many on Christmas Day. So, if I fail to come, don't let Standish create any misunderstandings between us again," he laughed, secure in the thought that his enemy was safe in prison.
<p>Geraldine promised very sincerely to trust her love, in spite of a hundred plots against him, and then they called Cissy in, and told her happily of their betrothal.
<p>"I am the happiest man in New York to-night," he said, as he bade them good-night, leaving them to their sweet, girlish confidences.
<p>Mrs. Alex. McVeigh Miller.
<p>How much the two happy girls had to say to each other, when Hawthorne was gone!
<p>It was long past midnight when they retired, and the joyous Christmas sounds were already filling the air. Even then they could not sleep, they had so many things to tell of all that had happened since they were parted from each other.
<p>"I am quite cured of my passion for the stage. It seems to me that all actors must be deceitful villains!" cried Geraldine, and Cissy agreed with her, glad of her disillusionment.
<p>"Do you think, Cissy," pursued Geraldine, "that I could get back my place at O'Neill's with you? Oh, I would be so glad to get back again!"
<p>"We will try to manage it," replied Cissy. "One of the girls is to be married soon after New Year's, and perhaps you can have her place. I'll see about it as soon as I go back to the store; but we have Christmas holiday to-morrow."
<p>"Yes; what a happy Christmas it will be for me!" cried Geraldine, thinking of what might have been, with a shudder. She laughed, to choke back a sob, and continued: "Let's hang up our stockings to-morrow night, as it's too late now, and fill them for each other as we did last Christmas."
<p>"Agreed, my dear; it will be great fun," laughed Cissy, and added: "I suppose your Christmas gift from Mr. Hawthorne will be - an engagement-ring."
<p>"Oh, Cissy, how nice that would be! Do you think he can afford it? Firemen aren't very rich, are they?" naively.
<p>"I guess not; but of course he will give you a ring, even if it's a plain gold band, that will do also for a marriage-ring when the wedding comes off."
<p>"No matter how simple a ring he gives me, I shall love it, and be proud of it, for his sake - just as proud of it as if it were a splendid diamond!" cried pretty Geraldine, tenderly, and then she laughed and said, further: "I used to be such a silly little goose, thinking I would never love and marry any man who could not give me silks and diamonds; but love has changed my nature, and I prize Harry's love more than anything on earth. Of course, I still admire beautiful, costly things, but I would not give him in exchange for a millionaire."
<p>"You are right, dear. Although it is well to have love and wealth, too, yet love is the best of all, and I would not barter it for anything on earth," answered Cissy, so earnestly that Geraldine put her arm around her neck and whispered, coaxingly:
<p>"Dear, you have always spoken so sweetly of love - and yet you do not seem to care for lovers yourself. Why is it? Have you never loved any one?"
<p>Geraldine felt her companion tremble a little, then she replied, lightly:
<p>"That is a leading question - as the lawyers say - and I don't believe I will answer it just yet. Wait - I will tell you another time."
<p>And her answer only confirmed Geraldine in the belief she had cherished for a long time that there was a romance in Cissy's past - some love-story that had somewhat saddened her life and made her lips and eyes so sweetly pensive. From her own happy heart swelled up a silent prayer that love and joy might come soon to Cissy's life, with the same rich blessings it brought to her own.
<p>"Now cuddle your head on your pillow, dear, and go off to the land of Nod, or you will not look pretty for your sweetheart to-morrow," commanded Cissy; and soon they were both fast asleep and wandering in the land of dreams, from which they did not return until the light of day peeped in at the windows.
<p>"Good gracious! it must be eight o'clock! I've overslept myself this blessed Christmas morning. A good thing I don't have to go to the store to-day!" Cissy cried, springing out of bed and running to the window, where she thrust aside the curtain and peered out into the street.
<p>A beautiful sight presented itself - a great city clothed in a resplendent mantle of deep snow, that had come between the dark and the dawn, and overhead a clear, blue sky and brilliant sunshine.
<p>"Oh, how grand! how beautiful! and what glorious sleighing there will be to-day! Wake up, Geraldine, and see the beautiful Christmas morn!" cried the young girl, who, although she had so little of this world's goods, and did not expect a single Christmas gift, was unselfishly happy in the prospect of pleasure for others.
<p>But they had scarcely finished their simple breakfast, gayly prepared by both their hands, when there was a knock at the door, and several packages were handed in for both of them - a little feast of fruit and confectioneries, jewel-box, with a dainty pin for Cissy, and another for Geraldine, with a ring. The gifts bore the card of Harry Hawthorne.
<p>"Oh, how lovely in him to remember me like this! I shall fall in love with him myself! This dear brooch! How I adore it! See the dear little enameled violets, with dewy centers like real diamonds! Oh, how generous he is!" Cissy cried, rapturously, while Geraldine paled with emotion as she slipped over her finger a beautiful ring, and held it up for inspection.
<p>Cissy went almost dumb at the sight, for the stone was a pure diamond of good size, and worth more than either girl had any idea of in their ignorance of the value of gems.
<p>"Oh, Cissy, it is a real diamond, is it not? See how it glitters!" cried Geraldine, tremulously, as she turned her hand about, admiring the sparkling rays of light.
<p>She was fairly overwhelmed with joy at this beautiful gift from her lover, and continued, breathlessly:
<p>"Oh, it is so beautiful! I am so proud to have it! But - but - wasn't he rather - extravagant, Cissy? I should not have thought he could afford it, for surely it must have cost a hundred dollars at least - don't you think so?"
<p>"More than that, in my judgment," cried Cissy, finding breath after her rapturous amazement, and continuing: "But it is none too pretty or costly for you, my beautiful darling, if he can afford it; and of course he can, or he would not have sent it. Perhaps he is not as poor as we thought. He looks like a prince in disguise, anyway, he's so stately and handsome!"
<p>She paused, for Geraldine had found a note in the box, and was reading it.
<p>"My Own Darling: - I am disconsolate this morning because I could not get leave of absence to come to you," wrote Hawthorne, fondly, "but I couldn't get a man to take my place at the engine-house to-day, and I daren't desert my post, for there have been two fires already this morning, and I was out with my engine in the driving snow of dawn, while you, I hope, were wrapped in slumber and sweet dreams of your adoring sweetheart!
<p>"Isn't the snow fine? I shall try my hardest to get off in time to take you and Cissy for a grand sleigh-ride before the day is ended.
<p>"I send you both some bon-bons and fruits, with a brooch for Cissy, and a ring for you. You will be asking yourself how can a poor fireman afford to give diamonds to his betrothed and her dear friend! Well, darling, both trinkets were heir-looms from my dead mother, who was richer in worldly goods than her son. So the little mystery is explained.
<p>"God bless you and keep you, my beloved, until we meet again, which I trust and hope may be this afternoon.
<p>Harry."
<p>Geraldine gave her friend the note to read, then they discussed some of the dainties, while Cissy said, regretfully:
<p>"If I had only known yesterday that I should have you with me to-day, I should have prepared a real little feast for our dinner, but I felt so lonely and sad I prepared nothing extra, and now I really must slip out and buy something good. What would you like, dear - a dear little chicken and some oysters? For a turkey would be too big for us two!"
<p>"Oh, some oysters, please; I am so fond of them, and they are not so good out West, where I traveled so long," cried Geraldine, with real girlish delight, it seemed so jolly to be back with Cissy, playing at housekeeping again.
<p>"I'll never leave my darling again until - I marry!" she thought, with kindling blushes, and while Cissy was gone she employed her time writing a very polite note to Mr. Cameron Clemens, the manager of the Clemens Company, resigning her situation, to take effect at once.
<p>When she remembered Mr. Clemens, she felt a little remorseful over her denunciation of all actors last night, for she had found this one very kind and clever during her engagement with the company.
<p>She went down stairs and engaged the landlady's son to take her note at once to the hotel where the manager was staying, and then tried to dismiss the matter from her mind, but she felt a little remorseful, for Laurel Vane was billed to appear again to-night, and she knew it could not go on, now that she and Standish had both withdrawn - that was, of course, unless the latter could get free from prison, which did not seem likely, considering the nature of the charge against him.
<p>When Cissy came in, Geraldine said, happily:
<p>"I feel as free as a bird, for I have sent in my resignation in the Clemens Company, and now I shall not have to leave you any more."
<p>"Until Mr. Hawthorne steals you away from me," amended Cissy, kissing her rosy cheek before she hurried into the adjoining room to prepare her little Christmas dinner.
<p>"Let me help you!" pleaded Geraldine.
<p>"Oh, no, you shall be company come to dine to-day. And, besides, you must stay dressed up, to receive callers."
<p>"But there's no one to call."
<p>"Oh, yes, there is," and her words proved true, for before the day ended there came Mrs. Stansbury, with her three sisters, Carrie, Consuelo, and Mrs. Charles Butler, the lovely bride of whom Geraldine had been so horribly jealous.
<p>How glad they all were to see her again; how they petted and made much of her, denouncing Clifford Standish for a real villain.
<p>"And you're engaged to that splendid Hawthorne - how charming! Oh, you needn't blush! He told my husband this morning, and we all hurried off to wish you joy," cried volatile Mrs. Stansbury.
<p>At last the Stansburys were gone, but then some of the girls from O'Neill's dropped in. It was a merry, happy day to Geraldine, with but one shadow on its brightness - the absence of Hawthorne.
<p>At every knock she started up, all blissful, blushing confusion, thinking that surely this time it was he, but each time she was doomed to a sad disappointment.
<p>But from the constant ringing of fire alarms through the day she easily guessed what kept him from her side.
<p>But when the afternoon was far spent, and the sunlight grew pale and cold, there was a masculine step at the door that made her heart throb quickly again with eager hope as she sprang to open it, thinking:
<p>"I cannot be mistaken. He is come at last!"
<p>But the next moment she stood face to face with the handsome manager, Cameron Clemens.
<p>And as he entered there was a soft little swish of skirts as Cissy fled to the next room.
<p>"How she hates anybody connected with the stage!" thought Geraldine, amusedly.
<p>The manager had come to entreat her to reconsider her resignation.
<p>He could get some one else to take the place of Standish in the play, if she would only go on, he said.
<p>But Geraldine was obdurate. She told the manager frankly that she was engaged, and her betrothed objected to her return to the stage.
<p>"I am very sorry for your disappointment," she said; "I like you, and you have been very kind to me, but my betrothed objects, you see, and that settles the case with me."
<p>Mr. Clemens did not fly into a rage, as many another would have done in his place. He wished Geraldine joy, told her that the stage had lost an ornament in her withdrawal from it, presented her with the amount of salary still due her, and took a courteous leave.
<p>He knew that he could put on another play, in which the remainder of the company could do very well that night, but he sorely regretted the loss of Geraldine, who had certainly proved a drawing card.
<p>But he could not help the turn of events, so he went his way, bitterly disappointed, while Geraldine called into the other room:
<p>"You can come back now, Cissy, for Mr. Clemens is gone. But, you silly girl, why did you run away? I wished you to know him, he is so nice and handsome!"
<p>There was no answer from her friend, and she went back into the room.
<p>There was Cissy, on a low seat in the darkest corner, and presently there came a low, stifled sob.
<p>Geraldine flung herself on her knees by her friend, in great surprise and alarm.
<p>"Oh, my darling girl! what ails you? Are you sick? Did the bonbons disagree with you?"
<p>"No-o-o!" sighed Cissy.
<p>"Then what is it, dear? Are you in trouble? Or were you angry because the manager came here? But this shall be the last of any stage visitors, I assure you! Or do you want me to go away, Cissy?" plaintively.
<p>"Oh, Gerry, you will drive me mad with your questions! I'll have to tell you my guarded secret!"
<p>Mrs. Alex. McVeigh Miller.
<p>Most bitter were the reflections of the elegant villain, Clifford Standish, during the long night in his prison-cell.
<p>He knew too well that the charge against him was perfectly true, and that his boast to Geraldine that he would clear himself at court was absolutely false.
<p>Two years before, he had secretly married a piquant variety actress, of whom he had soon wearied, but from whose fetters he could not get free.
<p>Her life was absolutely irreproachable, and he could find no flaw in it on which to base an application for divorce.
<p>And all of his flagrant violations of faith, although known too well to his wife, did not goad her to seek release from him.
<p>She loved him, poor creature, with that dog-like devotion seen in some women of average intellect, who love the hand that smites them. She was romantic, and called it constancy; other women called it lack of spirit.
<p>She could not and did not comprehend the baseness of the man she loved.
