<p>The scene is the managing clerk's room, at the offices of James and Walter How, on a July morning. The room is old fashioned, furnished with well-worn mahogany and leather, and lined with tin boxes and estate plans. It has three doors. Two of them are close together in the centre of a wall. One of these two doors leads to the outer office, which is only divided from the managing clerk's room by a partition of wood and clear glass; and when the door into this outer office is opened there can be seen the wide outer door leading out on to the stone stairway of the building. The other of these two centre doors leads to the junior clerk's room. The third door is that leading to the partners' room. The managing clerk, COKESON, is sitting at his table adding up figures in a pass-book, and murmuring their numbers to himself. He is a man of sixty, wearing spectacles; rather short, with a bald head, and an honest, pugdog face. He is dressed in a well-worn black frock-coat and pepper-and-salt trousers.
<p>He again makes a tick. The outer office door is opened, and SWEEDLE, the office-boy, appears, closing the door behind him. He is a pale youth of sixteen, with spiky hair.
<p>SWEEDLE. There's a party wants to see Falder, Mr. Cokeson.
<p>COKESON. Five, nine, sixteen, twenty-one, twenty-nine - and carry two. Send him to Morris's. What name?
<p>SWEEDLE. Honeywill.
<p>COKESON. What's his business?
<p>SWEEDLE. It's a woman.
<p>COKESON. A lady?
<p>SWEEDLE. No, a person.
<p>RUTH HONEYWILL comes in. She is a tall woman, twenty-six years old, unpretentiously dressed, with black hair and eyes, and an ivory-white, clear-cut face. She stands very still, having a natural dignity of pose and gesture. SWEEDLE goes out into the partners' room with the pass-book.
<p>COKESON. We don't allow private callers here. Will you leave a message?
<p>RUTH. I'd rather see him, please.
<p>She narrows her dark eyes and gives him a honeyed look.
<p>RUTH. No, sir.
<p>RUTH. Yes, sir; I must see him.
<p>RUTH. He's not there.
<p>RUTH. No, sir.
<p>RUTH. But what am I to do?
<p>COKESON. Dear me! I can't tell you that.
<p>SWEEDLE comes back. He crosses to the outer office and passes through into it, with a quizzical look at Cokeson, carefully leaving the door an inch or two open.
<p>An incoherent knocking and chuckling is heard from the outer door of the outer office.
<p>RUTH. They're mine, please.
<p>SWEEDLE. Shall I hold them in check?
<p>COKESON. You mustn't take up his time in office hours; we're a clerk short as it is.
<p>RUTH. It's a matter of life and death.
<p>SWEEDLE. Here is Falder.
<p>FALDER has entered through the outer office. He is a pale, good-looking young man, with quick, rather scared eyes. He moves towards the door of the clerks' office, and stands there irresolute.
<p>COKESON. Well, I'll give you a minute. It's not regular.
<p>Taking up a bundle of papers, he goes out into the partners' room.
<p>FALDER. I've changed my digs.
<p>RUTH. Is it all ready for to-night?
<p>RUTH. You're not afraid of going, are you?
<p>FALDER. Have you got your things, and the children's?
<p>RUTH. Had to leave them, for fear of waking Honeywill, all but one bag. I can't go near home again.
<p>RUTH. Six pounds - I could do with that, I think.
<p>RUTH. If you're sorry, say so. I'd sooner he killed me than take you against your will.
<p>RUTH. You've just to say; it's not too late.
<p>FALDER. It is too late. Here's seven pounds. Booking office 11.45 to-night. If you weren't what you are to me, Ruth - - !
<p>RUTH. Kiss me!
<p>They cling together passionately, there fly apart just as COKESON re-enters the room. RUTH turns and goes out through the outer office. COKESON advances deliberately to his chair and seats himself.
<p>COKESON. This isn't right, Falder.
<p>FALDER. It shan't occur again, sir.
<p>COKESON. It's an improper use of these premises.
<p>FALDER. Yes, sir.
<p>COKESON. And look here, Falder, before Mr. Walter comes, have you finished up that cataloguing Davis had in hand before he left?
<p>FALDER. I shall have done with it to-morrow, sir - for good.
<p>COKESON. It's over a week since Davis went. Now it won't do, Falder. You're neglecting your work for private life. I shan't mention about the party having called, but - -
<p>COKESON stares at the door through which FALDER has gone out; then shakes his head, and is just settling down to write, when WALTER How comes in through the outer Office. He is a rather refined-looking man of thirty-five, with a pleasant, almost apologetic voice.
<p>WALTER. Good-morning, Cokeson.
<p>COKESON. Morning, Mr. Walter.
<p>WALTER. My father here?
<p>WALTER. I've been in to see the pictures, at the Guildhall.
<p>WALTER. What does my father say?
<p>COKESON. 'Aven't bothered him.
<p>WALTER. Well, we can't be too careful.
<p>COKESON. It's such a little thing - hardly worth the fees. I thought you'd do it yourself.
<p>WALTER. Send it, please. I don't want the responsibility.
<p>WALTER. I know; but the intention was obviously to exclude that bit of common ground.
<p>COKESON. We needn't worry about that. We're the right side of the law.
<p>WALTER. I don't like it,
<p>As he speaks JAMES How comes in from the partners' room. He is a shortish man, with white side-whiskers, plentiful grey hair, shrewd eyes, and gold pince-nez.
<p>JAMES. Morning, Walter.
<p>WALTER. How are you, father?
<p>WALTER. About that right-of-way case?
<p>JAMES. Oh, well, we must go forward there. I thought you told me yesterday the firm's balance was over four hundred.
<p>WALTER. So it is.
<p>WALTER goes to a cupboard, unlocks a drawer and produces a cheque-book.
<p>JAMES. Tick the pounds in the counterfoils. Five, fifty-four, seven, five, twenty-eight, twenty, ninety, eleven, fifty-two, seventy-one. Tally?
<p>WALTER. Who drew it?
<p>JAMES. You.
<p>JAMES. Look at that 't' 'y': that yours?
<p>COKESON. Ye-es. Nine pounds.
<p>He takes cheque-book and pass-book from WALTER.
<p>WALTER. Afraid not.
<p>JAMES. You gave it to Davis, and Davis sailed for Australia on Monday. Looks black, Cokeson.
<p>JAMES. I hope so.
<p>COKESON. There's never been anything of that sort in the office the twenty-nine years I've been here.
<p>JAMES. The counterfoil altered too - very deliberate piece of swindling. What was Davis's ship?
<p>WALTER. 'City of Rangoon'.
<p>JAMES. We ought to wire and have him arrested at Naples; he can't be there yet.
<p>COKESON. His poor young wife. I liked the young man. Dear, oh dear! In this office!
<p>WALTER. Shall I go to the bank and ask the cashier?
<p>WALTER. Really?
<p>He goes out through the outer office. JAMES paces the room. He stops and looks at COKESON, who is disconsolately rubbing the knees of his trousers.
<p>JAMES. Well, Cokeson! There's something in character, isn't there?
<p>JAMES. Your story, would sound d - - d thin to any one who didn't know you.
<p>JAMES. A nasty business!
<p>COKESON. It unsettles you. All goes on regular, and then a thing like this happens. Shan't relish my lunch to-day.
<p>JAMES. As bad as that, Cokeson?
<p>JAMES. Not so fast. We haven't convicted him yet.
<p>JAMES. I hope that fellow will hurry up.
<p>JAMES. The idea of dishonesty about this office it hits me hard, Cokeson.
<p>He goes towards the door of the partners' room.
<p>JAMES. What's that?
<p>RUTH. Not for a minute, sir?
<p>COKESON. Reely! Reely! I can't have it. If you want him, wait about; he'll be going out for his lunch directly.
<p>RUTH. Yes, sir.
<p>WALTER, entering with the cashier, passes RUTH as she leaves the outer office.
<p>WALTER crosses and goes into the partners' room.
<p>COKESON. It's a nahsty, unpleasant little matter, Mr. Cowley. I'm quite ashamed to have to trouble you.
<p>COKESON. Sit down, won't you? I'm not a sensitive man, but a thing like this about the place - it's not nice. I like people to be open and jolly together.
<p>COWLEY. Quite so.
<p>COWLEY. I should remember the person's face - quite a youth.
<p>COKESON. I don't think we shall be able to show him to you, as a matter of fact.
<p>JAMES and WALTER have come back from the partners' room.
<p>JAMES. Good-morning, Mr. Cowley. You've seen my son and myself, you've seen Mr. Cokeson, and you've seen Sweedle, my office-boy. It was none of us, I take it.
<p>The cashier shakes his head with a smile.
<p>JAMES. Be so good as to sit there. Cokeson, engage Mr. Cowley in conversation, will you?
<p>He goes toward FALDER'S room.
<p>COKESON. Just a word, Mr. James.
<p>JAMES. Well?
<p>COKESON. You don't want to upset the young man in there, do you? He's a nervous young feller.
<p>JAMES. This must be thoroughly cleared up, Cokeson, for the sake of Falder's name, to say nothing of yours.
<p>JAMES. It's a matter of form; but I can't stand upon niceness over a thing like this - too serious. Just talk to Mr. Cowley.
<p>He opens the door of FALDER'S room.
<p>JAMES. Bring in the papers in Boulter's lease, will you, Falder?
<p>The cashier, with his eyes fixed on the door, does not answer.
<p>COKESON. You haven't such a thing as a bulldog pup you could spare me, I suppose?
<p>At the look on the cashier's face his jaw drops, and he turns to see FALDER standing in the doorway, with his eyes fixed on COWLEY, like the eyes of a rabbit fastened on a snake.
<p>FALDER. Do you want me, sir?
<p>JAMES. No, thanks!
<p>FALDER turns and goes back into his own room. As he shuts the door JAMES gives the cashier an interrogative look, and the cashier nods.
<p>JAMES. Sure? This isn't as we suspected.
<p>COWLEY. Quite. He knew me. I suppose he can't slip out of that room?
<p>The door of FALDER'S room is quietly opened, and FALDER, with his hat in his hand, moves towards the door of the outer office.
<p>FALDER. To have my lunch, sir.
<p>JAMES. Wait a few minutes, would you? I want to speak to you about this lease.
<p>JAMES. Good-morning, Mr. Cowley!
<p>The cashier goes out through the outer office. COKESON sits down in his chair, as though it were the only place left in the morass of his feelings.
<p>WALTER. What are you going to do?
<p>JAMES. Have him in. Give me the cheque and the counterfoil.
<p>COKESON. I don't understand. I thought young Davis - -
<p>JAMES. We shall see.
<p>WALTER. One moment, father: have you thought it out?
<p>JAMES. Call him in!
<p>FALDER. No, sir.
<p>JADES. Look at it. You cashed it last Friday week.
<p>FALDER. Oh! yes, sir; that one - Davis gave it me.
<p>JAMES. I know. And you gave Davis the cash?
<p>FALDER. Yes, sir.
<p>JAMES. When Davis gave you the cheque was it exactly like this?
<p>FALDER. Yes, I think so, sir.
<p>JAMES. You know that Mr. Walter drew that cheque for nine pounds?
<p>FALDER. No, sir - ninety.
<p>JAMES. Nine, Falder.
<p>JAMES. The suggestion, of course, is that the cheque was altered; whether by you or Davis is the question.
<p>COKESON. Take your time, take your time.
<p>JAMES. The cheque was handed to - Cokeson by Mr. Walter at one o'clock; we know that because Mr. Cokeson's lunch had just arrived.
<p>COKESON. I couldn't leave it.
<p>JAMES. Exactly; he therefore gave the cheque to Davis. It was cashed by you at 1.15. We know that because the cashier recollects it for the last cheque he handled before his lunch.
<p>FALDER. Yes, sir, Davis gave it to me because some friends were giving him a farewell luncheon.
<p>FALDER. I don't know, sir - it's very funny.
<p>WALTER, who has come close to his father, says something to him in a low voice.
<p>JAMES. Davis was not here again after that Saturday, was he?
<p>JAMES. Was he, Falder?
<p>JAMES. Very well, then, how do you account for the fact that this nought was added to the nine in the counterfoil on or after Tuesday?
<p>FALDER gives a sort of lurch; he tries to pull himself together, but he has gone all to pieces.
<p>FALDER. No, sir - no, Mr. How. I did it, sir; I did it.
<p>FALDER. I wanted the money so badly, sir. I didn't know what I was doing.
<p>COKESON. However such a thing could have come into your head!
<p>FALDER. Sir, I swear I didn't know what I'd done till afterwards, and then I hadn't the pluck. Oh! Sir, look over it! I'll pay the money back - I will, I promise.
<p>JAMES. Go into your room.
<p>FALDER, with a swift imploring look, goes back into his room. There is silence.
<p>JAMES. About as bad a case as there could be.
<p>COKESON. To break the law like that-in here!
<p>WALTER. What's to be done?
<p>JAMES. Nothing for it. Prosecute.
<p>WALTER. It's his first offence.
<p>COKESON. I shouldn't be surprised if he was tempted.
<p>JAMES. Life's one long temptation, Cokeson.
<p>COKESON. Ye-es, but I'm speaking of the flesh and the devil, Mr. James. There was a woman come to see him this morning.
<p>WALTER. The woman we passed as we came in just now. Is it his wife?
<p>WALTER. How do you know?
<p>JAMES. A real bad egg.
<p>WALTER. I should like to give him a chance.
<p>JAMES. I can't forgive him for the sneaky way he went to work - counting on our suspecting young Davis if the matter came to light. It was the merest accident the cheque-book stayed in your pocket.
<p>WALTER. It must have been the temptation of a moment. He hadn't time.
<p>JAMES. A man doesn't succumb like that in a moment, if he's a clean mind and habits. He's rotten; got the eyes of a man who can't keep his hands off when there's money about.
<p>WALTER. It's penal servitude.
<p>COKESON. They're nahsty places-prisons.
<p>JAMES. Equally out of the question to send him out amongst people who've no knowledge of his character. One must think of society.
<p>WALTER. But to brand him like this?
<p>JAMES. If it had been a straightforward case I'd give him another chance. It's far from that. He has dissolute habits.
<p>COKESON. I didn't say that - extenuating circumstances.
<p>JAMES. Same thing. He's gone to work in the most cold-blooded way to defraud his employers, and cast the blame on an innocent man. If that's not a case for the law to take its course, I don't know what is.
<p>WALTER. For the sake of his future, though.
<p>COKESON. That's rather 'ex parte', Mr. Walter! We must have protection.
<p>JAMES. This is degenerating into talk.
<p>He moves towards the partners' room.
<p>WALTER. Put yourself in his place, father.
<p>JAMES. You ask too much of me.
<p>WALTER. We can't possibly tell the pressure there was on him.
<p>JAMES. You may depend on it, my boy, if a man is going to do this sort of thing he'll do it, pressure or no pressure; if he isn't nothing'll make him.
<p>WALTER. He'll never do it again.
<p>WALTER. Confound it, Cokeson! why don't you back me up? You know you feel - -
<p>WALTER. We shall regret it.
<p>COKESON. He must have known what he was doing.
<p>COKESON. Put it down!
<p>While SWEEDLE is putting it down on COKESON's table, the detective, WISTER, enters the outer office, and, finding no one there, comes to the inner doorway. He is a square, medium-sized man, clean-shaved, in a serviceable blue serge suit and strong boots.
<p>He goes into the partners' room. JAMES enters.
<p>As FALDER comes shrinkingly out, the detective in obedience to a sign from JAMES, slips his hand out and grasps his arm.
<p>WALTER. Come, come, there's a good lad.
<p>JAMES. I charge him with felony.
<p>FALTER. Oh, sir! There's some one - I did it for her. Let me be till to-morrow.
<p>JAMES motions with his hand. At that sign of hardness, FALDER becomes rigid. Then, turning, he goes out quietly in the detective's grip. JAMES follows, stiff and erect. SWEEDLE, rushing to the door with open mouth, pursues them through the outer office into the corridor. When they have all disappeared COKESON spins completely round and makes a rush for the outer office.
<p>There is silence. He takes out his handkerchief and mops the sweat from his face. Going back blindly to his table, sits down, and stares blankly at his lunch.
<p>The curtain falls.
<p>A Court of Justice, on a foggy October afternoon crowded with barristers, solicitors, reporters, ushers, and jurymen. Sitting in the large, solid dock is FALDER, with a warder on either side of him, placed there for his safe custody, but seemingly indifferent to and unconscious of his presence. FALDER is sitting exactly opposite to the JUDGE, who, raised above the clamour of the court, also seems unconscious of and indifferent to everything. HAROLD CLEAVER, the counsel for the Crown, is a dried, yellowish man, of more than middle age, in a wig worn almost to the colour of his face. HECTOR FROME, the counsel for the defence, is a young, tall man, clean shaved, in a very white wig. Among the spectators, having already given their evidence, are JAMES and WALTER HOW, and COWLEY, the cashier. WISTER, the detective, is just leaving the witness-box.
<p>CLEAVER. That is the case for the Crown, me lud!
<p>Gathering his robes together, he sits down.
<p>JUDGE. Is this relevant, Mr. Frome?
<p>FROME. My lord, I submit, extremely - I shall be able to show your lordship that directly.
<p>JUDGE. Very well.
<p>FROME. In these circumstances, what alternatives were left to her? She could either go on living with this drunkard, in terror of her life; or she could apply to the Court for a separation order. Well, gentlemen, my experience of such cases assures me that this would have given her very insufficient protection from the violence of such a man; and even if effectual would very likely have reduced her either to the workhouse or the streets - for it's not easy, as she is now finding, for an unskilled woman without means of livelihood to support herself and her children without resorting either to the Poor Law or - to speak quite plainly - to the sale of her body.
<p>JUDGE. You are ranging rather far, Mr. Frome.
<p>FROME. I shall fire point-blank in a minute, my lord.
<p>JUDGE. Let us hope so.
<p>COKESON is summoned into court, and goes into the witness-box, holding his hat before him. The oath is administered to him.
<p>FROME. What is your name?
<p>COKESON. Robert Cokeson.
<p>FROME. Are you managing clerk to the firm of solicitors who employ the prisoner?
<p>COKESON. Ye-es.
<p>FROME. How long had the prisoner been in their employ?
<p>COKESON. Two years. No, I'm wrong there - all but seventeen days.
<p>FROME. Had you him under your eye all that time?
<p>COKESON. Except Sundays and holidays.
<p>FROME. Quite so. Let us hear, please, what you have to say about his general character during those two years.
<p>FROME. Did he ever give you reason to suspect his honesty?
<p>COKESON. No! To have dishonesty in our office, that'd never do.
<p>FROME. I'm sure the jury fully appreciate that, Mr. Cokeson.
<p>COKESON. Every man of business knows that honesty's 'the sign qua non'.
<p>FROME. Do you give him a good character all round, or do you not?
<p>FROME. Now, coming to the morning of the 7th of July, the morning on which the cheque was altered. What have you to say about his demeanour that morning?
<p>COKESON. Not compos.
<p>THE JUDGE. A little more precision, please.
<p>FROME. Will you tell us how you came to that conclusion?
<p>COKESON. Ye-es, I will. I have my lunch in from the restaurant, a chop and a potato - saves time. That day it happened to come just as Mr. Walter How handed me the cheque. Well, I like it hot; so I went into the clerks' office and I handed the cheque to Davis, the other clerk, and told him to get change. I noticed young Falder walking up and down. I said to him: "This is not the Zoological Gardens, Falder."
<p>FROME. Do you remember what he answered?
<p>COKESON. Ye-es: "I wish to God it were!" Struck me as funny.
<p>FROME. Did you notice anything else peculiar?
<p>COKESON. I did.
<p>FROME. What was that?
<p>COKESON. His collar was unbuttoned. Now, I like a young man to be neat. I said to him: "Your collar's unbuttoned."
<p>FROME. And what did he answer?
<p>COKESON. Stared at me. It wasn't nice.
<p>THE JUDGE. Stared at you? Isn't that a very common practice?
<p>COKESON. Ye-es, but it was the look in his eyes. I can't explain my meaning - it was funny.
<p>FROME. Had you ever seen such a look in his eyes before?
<p>COKESON. No. If I had I should have spoken to the partners. We can't have anything eccentric in our profession.
<p>THE JUDGE. Did you speak to them on that occasion?
<p>FROME. But it made a very distinct impression on your mind?
<p>COKESON. Ye-es. The clerk Davis could have told you the same.
<p>FROME. Quite so. It's very unfortunate that we've not got him here. Now can you tell me of the morning on which the discovery of the forgery was made? That would be the 18th. Did anything happen that morning?
<p>FROME. Was there anything in the course of that morning - I mean before the discovery - that caught your attention?
<p>COKESON. Ye-es - a woman.
<p>THE JUDGE. How is this relevant, Mr. Frome?
<p>FROME. I am trying to establish the state of mind in which the prisoner committed this act, my lord.
<p>THE JUDGE. I quite appreciate that. But this was long after the act.
<p>FROME. Yes, my lord, but it contributes to my contention.
<p>THE JUDGE. Well!
<p>FROME. You say a woman. Do you mean that she came to the office?
<p>COKESON. Ye-es.
<p>FROME. What for?
<p>COKESON. Asked to see young Falder; he was out at the moment.
<p>FROME. Did you see her?
<p>COKESON. I did.
<p>FROME. Did she come alone?
<p>FROME. Quite so, Mr. Cokeson, quite so - -
<p>THE JUDGE. What are? What were?
<p>COKESON. Her children. They were outside.
<p>THE JUDGE. HOW do you know?
<p>COKESON. Your lordship mustn't ask me that, or I shall have to tell you what I was told - and that'd never do.
<p>COKESON. Egg-zactly.
<p>FROME. What I want to ask you, Mr. Cokeson, is this. In the course of her appeal to see Falder, did the woman say anything that you specially remember?
<p>FROME. Or did she not?
<p>COKESON. She did. I shouldn't like you to have led me to the answer.
<p>COKESON. "It's a matter of life and death."
<p>FOREMAN OF THE JURY. Do you mean the woman said that?
<p>COKESON. Ah! there I can't follow you. I didn't see her go.
<p>FROME. Well, is she there now?
<p>CLEAVER. Thank you; I was coming to his eyes. You called them "funny." What are we to understand by that? Strange, or what?
<p>COKESON. Ye-es, funny.
<p>COKESON. You make it very hard for me. I give you the word, and you want me to give you another.
<p>CLEAVER. Not mad, fun - -
<p>CLEAVER. Very well! Now you say he had his collar unbuttoned? Was it a hot day?
<p>COKESON. Ye-es; I think it was.
<p>CLEAVER. And did he button it when you called his attention to it?
<p>COKESON. Ye-es, I think he did.
<p>CLEAVER. Would you say that that denoted insanity?
<p>He sits downs. COKESON, who has opened his mouth to reply, is left gaping.
<p>COKESON. No! He was always clean and quiet.
<p>FROME. That will do, thank you.
<p>COKESON turns blandly to the JUDGE, as though to rebuke counsel for not remembering that the JUDGE might wish to have a chance; arriving at the conclusion that he is to be asked nothing further, he turns and descends from the box, and sits down next to JAMES and WALTER.
<p>FROME. Ruth Honeywill.
<p>RUTH comes into court, and takes her stand stoically in the witness-box. She is sworn.
<p>FROME. What is your name, please?
<p>RUTH. Ruth Honeywill.
<p>FROME. How old are you?
<p>RUTH. Twenty-six.
<p>FROME. You are a married woman, living with your husband? A little louder.
<p>RUTH. No, sir; not since July.
<p>FROME. Have you any children?
<p>RUTH. Yes, sir, two.
<p>FROME. Are they living with you?
<p>RUTH. Yes, sir.
<p>FROME. You know the prisoner?
<p>FROME. What was the nature of your relations with him?
<p>RUTH. We were friends.
<p>THE JUDGE. Friends?
<p>RUTH. We love each other.
<p>THE JUDGE. Yes, but - -
<p>FROME. What is your husband?
<p>RUTH. Traveller.
<p>FROME. And what was the nature of your married life?
<p>FROME. Did he ill-treat you, or what?
<p>RUTH. Ever since my first was born.
<p>FROME. In what way?
<p>RUTH. I'd rather not say. All sorts of ways.
<p>THE JUDGE. I am afraid I must stop this, you know.
<p>RUTH. I was outside his office when he was taken away. It nearly broke my heart.
<p>FROME. You knew, then, that he had been arrested?
<p>FROME. Now, do you remember the morning of Friday, July 7th?
<p>RUTH. Yes.
<p>FROME. Why?
<p>RUTH. My husband nearly strangled me that morning.
<p>THE JUDGE. Nearly strangled you!
<p>FROME. With his hands, or - - ?
<p>RUTH. Yes, I just managed to get away from him. I went straight to my friend. It was eight o'clock.
<p>THE JUDGE. In the morning? Your husband was not under the influence of liquor then?
<p>RUTH. It wasn't always that.
<p>FROME. In what condition were you?
<p>RUTH. In very bad condition, sir. My dress was torn, and I was half choking.
<p>FROME. Did you tell your friend what had happened?
<p>RUTH. Yes. I wish I never had.
<p>FROME. It upset him?
<p>RUTH. Dreadfully.
<p>FROME. Did he ever speak to you about a cheque?
<p>RUTH. Never.
<p>FROZE. Did he ever give you any money?
<p>RUTH. Yes.
<p>FROME. When was that?
<p>RUTH. On Saturday.
<p>FROME. The 8th?
<p>RUTH. To buy an outfit for me and the children, and get all ready to start.
<p>FROME. Did that surprise you, or not?
<p>RUTH. What, sir?
<p>FROME. That he had money to give you.
<p>Ring. Yes, because on the morning when my husband nearly killed me my friend cried because he hadn't the money to get me away. He told me afterwards he'd come into a windfall.
<p>FROME. And when did you last see him?
<p>RUTH. The day he was taken away, sir. It was the day we were to have started.
<p>RUTH. Dumb - like - sometimes he didn't seem able to say a word.
<p>FROME. As if something unusual had happened to him?
<p>RUTH. Yes.
<p>FROME. Painful, or pleasant, or what?
<p>RUTH. Like a fate hanging over him.
<p>FROME. And had he a very great affection for you?
<p>FROME. Now, ma'am, do you or do you not think that your danger and unhappiness would seriously affect his balance, his control over his actions?
<p>RUTH. Yes.
<p>FROME. His reason, even?
<p>RUTH. For a moment like, I think it would.
<p>FROME. Was he very much upset that Friday morning, or was he fairly calm?
<p>RUTH. Dreadfully upset. I could hardly bear to let him go from me.
<p>FROME. Do you still love him?
<p>FROME. Thank you.
<p>He sits down. RUTH remains stoically upright in the witness-box.
<p>RUTH. No, sir.
<p>CLEAVER. Thank you; I've no further questions to ask you.
<p>THE JUDGE. Please, please! You say your married life is an unhappy one? Faults on both sides?
<p>RUTH. Only that I never bowed down to him. I don't see why I should, sir, not to a man like that.
<p>THE JUDGE. You refused to obey him?
<p>THE JUDGE. Until you met the prisoner - was that it?
<p>RUTH. No; even after that.
<p>THE JUDGE. I ask, you know, because you seem to me to glory in this affection of yours for the prisoner.
<p>RUTH looks at FALDER, then passes quietly down and takes her seat among the witnesses.
<p>FROME. I call the prisoner, my lord.
<p>FALDER leaves the dock; goes into the witness-box, and is duly sworn.
<p>FROME. What is your name?
<p>FALDER. William Falder.
<p>FROME. And age?
<p>FALDER. Twenty-three.
<p>FROME. You are not married?
<p>FALDER shakes his head
<p>FROME. How long have you known the last witness?
<p>FALDER. Six months.
<p>FROME. Is her account of the relationship between you a correct one?
<p>FALDER. Yes.
<p>FROME. You became devotedly attached to her, however?
<p>FALDER. Yes.
<p>THE JUDGE. Though you knew she was a married woman?
<p>FALDER. I couldn't help it, your lordship.
<p>THE JUDGE. Couldn't help it?
<p>FALDER. I didn't seem able to.
<p>The JUDGE slightly shrugs his shoulders.
<p>FROME. How did you come to know her?
<p>FALDER. Through my married sister.
<p>FROME. Did you know whether she was happy with her husband?
<p>FALDER. It was trouble all the time.
<p>FROME. You knew her husband?
<p>FALDER. Only through her - he's a brute.
<p>THE JUDGE. I can't allow indiscriminate abuse of a person not present.
<p>FALDER bows his head.
<p>FROME. Carry your mind, please, to the morning of Friday, July the 7th, and tell the jury what happened.
<p>FROME. Yes?
<p>FALDER. When she left me - because I had to go to the office - I was out of my senses for fear that he'd do it again, and thinking what I could do. I couldn't work - all the morning I was like that - simply couldn't fix my mind on anything. I couldn't think at all. I seemed to have to keep moving. When Davis - the other clerk - gave me the cheque - he said: "It'll do you good, Will, to have a run with this. You seem half off your chump this morning." Then when I had it in my hand - I don't know how it came, but it just flashed across me that if I put the 'ty' and the nought there would be the money to get her away. It just came and went - I never thought of it again. Then Davis went out to his luncheon, and I don't really remember what I did till I'd pushed the cheque through to the cashier under the rail. I remember his saying "Gold or notes?" Then I suppose I knew what I'd done. Anyway, when I got outside I wanted to chuck myself under a bus; I wanted to throw the money away; but it seemed I was in for it, so I thought at any rate I'd save her. Of course the tickets I took for the passage and the little I gave her's been wasted, and all, except what I was obliged to spend myself, I've restored. I keep thinking over and over however it was I came to do it, and how I can't have it all again to do differently!
<p>FALDER is silent, twisting his hands before him.
<p>FROME. How far is it from your office to the bank?
<p>FALDER. Not more than fifty yards, sir.
<p>FROME. From the time Davis went out to lunch to the time you cashed the cheque, how long do you say it must have been?
<p>FALDER. It couldn't have been four minutes, sir, because I ran all the way.
<p>FROME. During those four minutes you say you remember nothing?
<p>FALDER. No, sir; only that I ran.
<p>FROME. Not even adding the 'ty' and the nought?'
<p>FALDER. No, sir. I don't really.
<p>FROME sits down, and CLEAVER rises.
<p>CLEAVER. But you remember running, do you?
<p>FALDER. I was all out of breath when I got to the bank.
<p>CLEAVER. And you don't remember altering the cheque?
<p>CLEAVER. Divested of the romantic glamour which my friend is casting over the case, is this anything but an ordinary forgery? Come.
<p>FALDER. I was half frantic all that morning, sir.
<p>CLEAVER. Now, now! You don't deny that the 'ty' and the nought were so like the rest of the handwriting as to thoroughly deceive the cashier?
<p>FALDER. It was an accident.
<p>CLEAVER. Was that an accident too?
<p>CLEAVER. To do that you had to watch your opportunity, I suppose?
<p>CLEAVER. You don't suggest that you were suffering under great excitement when you did that?
<p>FALDER. I was haunted.
<p>CLEAVER. With the fear of being found out?
<p>THE JUDGE. Didn't it occur to you that the only thing for you to do was to confess to your employers, and restore the money?
<p>CLEAVER. You desired, too, no doubt, to complete your design of taking this woman away?
<p>FALDER. When I found I'd done a thing like that, to do it for nothing seemed so dreadful. I might just as well have chucked myself into the river.
<p>CLEAVER. You knew that the clerk Davis was about to leave England - didn't it occur to you when you altered this cheque that suspicion would fall on him?
<p>FALDER. It was all done in a moment. I thought of it afterwards.
<p>CLEAVER. And that didn't lead you to avow what you'd done?
<p>THE JUDGE. But in the meantime your innocent fellow clerk might have been prosecuted.
<p>FALDER. I knew he was a long way off, your lordship. I thought there'd be time. I didn't think they'd find it out so soon.
<p>FROME. I might remind your lordship that as Mr. Walter How had the cheque-book in his pocket till after Davis had sailed, if the discovery had been made only one day later Falder himself would have left, and suspicion would have attached to him, and not to Davis, from the beginning.
<p>FALDER. I - I - thought - he - -
<p>THE JUDGE. Now speak the truth-yes or no!
<p>THE JUDGE. That disposes of your point, Mr. Frome.
<p>CLEAVER. Has any aberration of this nature ever attacked you before?
<p>CLEAVER. You had recovered sufficiently to go back to your work that afternoon?
<p>FALDER. Yes, I had to take the money back.
<p>FALDER. If I hadn't been mad I should never have had the courage.
<p>FALDER. I never ate a thing all day; and at night I couldn't sleep.
<p>FROME. Now, as to the four minutes that elapsed between Davis's going out and your cashing the cheque: do you say that you recollect nothing during those four minutes?
<p>FROME. Of Mr. Cokeson's face! Had that any connection with what you were doing?
<p>FALDER. No, Sir.
<p>FROME. Was that in the office, before you ran out?
<p>FALDER. Yes, and while I was running.
<p>FROME. And that lasted till the cashier said: "Will you have gold or notes?"
<p>FALDER. Yes, and then I seemed to come to myself - and it was too late.
<p>FROME. Thank you. That closes the evidence for the defence, my lord.
<p>The JUDGE nods, and FALDER goes back to his seat in the dock.
<p>He holds up finger and thumb in the form of a circle, drops his hand, and sits dozen.
<p>The jury stir, and consult each other's faces; then they turn towards the counsel for the Crown, who rises, and, fixing his eyes on a spot that seems to give him satisfaction, slides them every now and then towards the jury.
<p>Letting his eyes travel from the JUDGE and the jury to FROME, he sits down.
<p>The jury retire by a door behind the JUDGE. The JUDGE bends over his notes. FALDER, leaning from the dock, speaks excitedly to his solicitor, pointing dawn at RUTH. The solicitor in turn speaks to FROME.
<p>THE JUDGE. H'm! Well.
<p>FROME. There is very real danger to her, your lordship.
<p>THE JUDGE. You see, I have to take your word for all that.
<p>FROME. If your lordship would be so kind. I can assure your lordship that I am not exaggerating.
<p>FROME. Your lordship, I really - -
<p>THE JUDGE. Yes, yes - I don't suggest anything of the sort, Mr. Frome. Leave it at that for the moment.
<p>As he finishes speaking, the jury return, and file back into the box.
<p>CLERK of ASSIZE. Gentlemen, are you agreed on your verdict?
<p>FOREMAN. We are.
<p>CLERK of ASSIZE. Is it Guilty, or Guilty but insane?
<p>FOREMAN. Guilty.
<p>The JUDGE nods; then, gathering up his notes, sits looking at FALDER, who stands motionless.
<p>THE JUDGE. I don't think you can, Mr. Frome.
<p>FALDER, who throughout the JUDGE'S speech has looked at him steadily, lets his head fall forward on his breast. RUTH starts up from her seat as he is taken out by the warders. There is a bustle in court.
<p>RUTH turns, stares at the JUDGE, and turns away.
<p>THE JUDGE. I shall sit rather late to-day. Call the next case.
<p>To cries of "Witnesses in the case of Booley":
<p>The curtain falls.
<p>A prison. A plainly furnished room, with two large barred windows, overlooking the prisoners' exercise yard, where men, in yellow clothes marked with arrows, and yellow brimless caps, are seen in single file at a distance of four yards from each other, walking rapidly on serpentine white lines marked on the concrete floor of the yard. Two warders in blue uniforms, with peaked caps and swords, are stationed amongst them. The room has distempered walls, a bookcase with numerous official-looking books, a cupboard between the windows, a plan of the prison on the wall, a writing-table covered with documents. It is Christmas Eve. The GOVERNOR, a neat, grave-looking man, with a trim, fair moustache, the eyes of a theorist, and grizzled hair, receding from the temples, is standing close to this writing-table looking at a sort of rough saw made out of a piece of metal. The hand in which he holds it is gloved, for two fingers are missing. The chief warder, WOODER, a tall, thin, military-looking man of sixty, with grey moustache and melancholy, monkey-like eyes, stands very upright two paces from him.
<p>WOODER. In his mattress, sir. Haven't come across such a thing for two years now.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. I'll see him this afternoon. What's his name? Moaney! An old hand, I think?
<p>THE GOVERNOR. Who's next him?
<p>WOODER. O'Cleary, sir.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. The Irishman.
<p>WOODER. Next him again there's that young fellow, Falder - star class - and next him old Clipton.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. Ah, yes! "The philosopher." I want to see him about his eyes.
<p>WOODER. Curious thing, sir: they seem to know when there's one of these tries at escape going on. It makes them restive - there's a regular wave going through them just now.
<p>WOODER. That Irishman, O'Cleary, began banging on his door this morning. Little thing like that's quite enough to upset the whole lot. They're just like dumb animals at times.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. I've seen it with horses before thunder - it'll run right through cavalry lines.
<p>The prison CHAPLAIN has entered. He is a dark-haired, ascetic man, in clerical undress, with a peculiarly steady, tight-lipped face and slow, cultured speech.
<p>THE CHAPLAIN. Useful-looking specimen.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. Account for the state of the men last day or two, Miller? Seems going through the whole place.
<p>THE CHAPLAIN. No. I don't know of anything.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. By the way, will you dine with us on Christmas Day?
<p>THE CHAPLAIN. To-morrow. Thanks very much.
<p>THE CHAPLAIN. Extraordinary perverted will-power - some of them. Nothing to be done till it's broken.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. And not much afterwards, I'm afraid. Ground too hard for golf?
<p>WOODER comes in again.
<p>WOODER. Visitor who's been seeing Q 3007 asks to speak to you, sir. I told him it wasn't usual.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. What about?
<p>WOODER. Shall I put him off, sir?
<p>WOODER motions to some one without, and as the visitor comes in withdraws.
<p>The visitor is COKESON, who is attired in a thick overcoat to the knees, woollen gloves, and carries a top hat.
<p>COKESON. I'm sorry to trouble you. I've been talking to the young man.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. We have a good many here.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. Not unnaturally.
<p>COKESON. I'm afraid it'll prey on my mind. I see a lot of them about working together.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. Those are local prisoners. The convicts serve their three months here in separate confinement, sir.
<p>COKESON. But we don't want to be unreasonable. He's quite downhearted. I wanted to ask you to let him run about with the others.
<p>COKESON. No. But it's a pitiful sight. He's quite a young fellow. I said to him: "Before a month's up" I said, "you'll be out and about with the others; it'll be a nice change for you." "A month!" he said - like that! "Come!" I said, "we mustn't exaggerate. What's a month? Why, it's nothing!" "A day," he said, "shut up in your cell thinking and brooding as I do, it's longer than a year outside. I can't help it," he said; "I try - but I'm built that way, Mr. COKESON." And, he held his hand up to his face. I could see the tears trickling through his fingers. It wasn't nice.
<p>THE CHAPLAIN. He's a young man with large, rather peculiar eyes, isn't he? Not Church of England, I think?
<p>COKESON. No.
<p>THE CHAPLAIN. I know.
<p>THE CHAPLAIN. If it wasn't for drink and women, sir, this prison might be closed.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. What was this news then?
<p>COKESON. Like this. The woman had a nahsty, spiteful feller for a husband, and she'd left him. Fact is, she was going away with our young friend. It's not nice - but I've looked over it. Well, when he was put in here she said she'd earn her living apart, and wait for him to come out. That was a great consolation to him. But after a month she came to me - I don't know her personally - and she said: "I can't earn the children's living, let alone my own - I've got no friends. I'm obliged to keep out of everybody's way, else my husband'd get to know where I was. I'm very much reduced," she said. And she has lost flesh. "I'll have to go in the workhouse!" It's a painful story. I said to her: "No," I said, "not that! I've got a wife an' family, but sooner than you should do that I'll spare you a little myself." "Really," she said - she's a nice creature - "I don't like to take it from you. I think I'd better go back to my husband." Well, I know he's a nahsty, spiteful feller - drinks - but I didn't like to persuade her not to.
<p>THE CHAPLAIN. Surely, no.
<p>COKESON. Ye-es, but I'm sorry now; it's upset the poor young fellow dreadfully. And what I wanted to say was: He's got his three years to serve. I want things to be pleasant for him.
<p>COKESON. But I can't help thinking that to shut him up there by himself'll turn him silly. And nobody wants that, I s'pose. I don't like to see a man cry.
<p>THE CHAPLAIN. It's a very rare thing for them to give way like that.
<p>THE CHAPLAIN. Indeed?
<p>COKESON. Ye-es. And I say this: I wouldn't shut one of them up all by himself, month after month, not if he'd bit me all over.
<p>THE CHAPLAIN. Unfortunately, the criminal is not a dog; he has a sense of right and wrong.
<p>COKESON. But that's not the way to make him feel it.
<p>THE CHAPLAIN. Ah! there I'm afraid we must differ.
<p>COKESON. It's the same with dogs. If you treat 'em with kindness they'll do anything for you; but to shut 'em up alone, it only makes 'em savage.
<p>THE CHAPLAIN. Surely you should allow those who have had a little more experience than yourself to know what is best for prisoners.
<p>During this speech the DOCTOR has entered. He is a medium-Sized, rather good-looking man, with a quick eye. He stands leaning against the window.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. This gentleman thinks the separate is telling on Q 3007 - Falder, young thin fellow, star class. What do you say, Doctor Clements?
<p>THE DOCTOR. He doesn't like it, but it's not doing him any harm.
<p>COKESON. But he's told me.
<p>THE DOCTOR. Of course he'd say so, but we can always tell. He's lost no weight since he's been here.
<p>COKESON. It's his state of mind I'm speaking of.
<p>THE DOCTOR. His mind's all right so far. He's nervous, rather melancholy. I don't see signs of anything more. I'm watching him carefully.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. I'll make a point of seeing him to-day.
<p>COKESON. I'm much obliged to you. I thought perhaps seeing him every day you wouldn't notice it.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. I think you may safely leave it to us, sir.
<p>As he goes out the three officials do not look at each other, but their faces wear peculiar expressions.
<p>THE CHAPLAIN. Our friend seems to think that prison is a hospital.
<p>He and the DOCTOR go out talking. The GOVERNOR, with a sigh, sits down at his table and takes up a pen.
<p>The curtain falls.
<p>Part of the ground corridor of the prison. The walls are coloured with greenish distemper up to a stripe of deeper green about the height of a man's shoulder, and above this line are whitewashed. The floor is of blackened stones. Daylight is filtering through a heavily barred window at the end. The doors of four cells are visible. Each cell door has a little round peep-hole at the level of a man's eye, covered by a little round disc, which, raised upwards, affords a view o f the cell. On the wall, close to each cell door, hangs a little square board with the prisoner's name, number, and record. Overhead can be seen the iron structures of the first-floor and second-floor corridors. The WARDER INSTRUCTOR, a bearded man in blue uniform, with an apron, and some dangling keys, is just emerging from one of the cells.
<p>O'CLEARY. An' that's the blessed truth.
<p>Sounds are heard of a cell door being closed and locked, and of approaching footsteps.
<p>He shuts the cell door, and stands at attention. The GOVERNOR comes walking down the corridor, followed by WOODER.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. Anything to report?
<p>The GOVERNOR nods and passes on to the end cell. The INSTRUCTOR goes away.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. This is our maker of saws, isn't it?
<p>He takes the saw from his pocket as WOODER throws open the door of the cell. The convict MOANEY is seen lying on his bed, athwart the cell, with his cap on. He springs up and stands in the middle of the cell. He is a raw-boned fellow, about fifty-six years old, with outstanding bat's ears and fierce, staring, steel-coloured eyes.
<p>MOANEY. It passed the time.
<p>MOANEY. It don't occupy your mind.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. Yes, and what then? Caught, brought back, punishment. Five weeks' hard work to make this, and cells at the end of it, while they put anew bar to your window. Is it worth it, Moaney?
<p>MOANEY. Thank 'e, sir.
<p>He turns quickly like an animal and slips into his cell. The GOVERNOR looks after him and shakes his head as WOODER closes and locks the cell door.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. Open Clipton's cell.
<p>WOODER opens the door of CLIPTON'S cell. CLIPTON is sitting on a stool just inside the door, at work on a pair of trousers. He is a small, thick, oldish man, with an almost shaven head, and smouldering little dark eyes behind smoked spectacles. He gets up and stands motionless in the doorway, peering at his visitors.
<p>CLIPTON, with a sort of dreadful quietness, comes into the corridor, the needle and thread in his hand. The GOVERNOR signs to WOODER, who goes into the cell and inspects it carefully.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. How are your eyes?
<p>THE GOVERNOR. What's the matter? I don't want any tales, Clipton.
<p>CLIPTON. He knocks about like a wild beast in the early morning. I'm not used to it - stops me getting my sleep out. In the evening too. It's not fair, Mr. Governor, as you're speaking to me. Sleep's the comfort I've got here; I'm entitled to take it out full.
<p>WOODER comes out of the cell, and instantly, as though extinguished, CLIPTON moves with stealthy suddenness back into his cell.
<p>WOODER. All right, sir.
<p>THE GOVERNOR nods. The door is closed and locked.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. Which is the man who banged on his door this morning?
<p>He lifts the disc and glances through the peephole.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. Open.
<p>WOODER throws open the door. O'CLEARY, who is seated at a little table by the door as if listening, springs up and stands at attention jest inside the doorway. He is a broad-faced, middle-aged man, with a wide, thin, flexible mouth, and little holes under his high cheek-bones.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. Where's the joke, O'Cleary?
<p>O'CLEARY. The joke, your honour? I've not seen one for a long time.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. Banging on your door?
<p>O'CLEARY. Oh! that!
<p>THE GOVERNOR. It's womanish.
<p>O'CLEARY. An' it's that I'm becoming this two months past.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. Anything to complain of?
<p>O'CLEARY. NO, Sirr.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. You're an old hand; you ought to know better.
<p>O'CLEARY. Yes, I've been through it all.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. You've got a youngster next door; you'll upset him.
<p>O'CLEARY. It cam' over me, your honour. I can't always be the same steady man.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. Work all right?
<p>THE GOVERNOR. You know as well as I do that if you were out in the shops you wouldn't be allowed to talk.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. Well, then?
<p>O'CLEARY. But it's the great conversation I'd have.
<p>O'CLEARY. No, sirr, I wud not have the little wit to repeat meself.
<p>O'CLEARY. Good-night, your honour.
<p>He turns into his cell. The GOVERNOR shuts the door.
<p>WOODER. He's an amiable man, sir.
<p>WOODER salutes and goes away down the corridor. The GOVERNOR goes to the door of FALDER'S cell. He raises his uninjured hand to uncover the peep-hole; but, without uncovering it, shakes his head and drops his hand; then, after scrutinising the record board, he opens the cell door. FALDER, who is standing against it, lurches forward.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. You know what I mean? It's no good running your head against a stone wall, is it?
<p>FALDER. No, sir.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. Well, come.
<p>FALDER. I try, sir.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. Can't you sleep?
<p>FALDER. Very little. Between two o'clock and getting up's the worst time.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. How's that?
<p>THE GOVERNOR. That's morbid, my lad. Pull yourself together.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. Think of all these other fellows?
<p>FALDER. They're used to it.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. They all had to go through it once for the first time, just as you're doing now.
<p>FALDER. Yes, sir, I shall get to be like them in time, I suppose.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. Take a good hold of yourself. Do you read?
<p>THE GOVERNOR. You've had a visitor. Bad news?
<p>FALDER. Yes.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. You mustn't think about it.
<p>He suddenly becomes motionless as WOODER and the DOCTOR approach. The GOVERNOR motions to him to go back into his cell.
<p>The DOCTOR goes into the cell. The GOVERNOR pushes the door to, nearly closing it, and walks towards the window.
<p>WOODER. Yes, sir. It's Christmas doing it, in my opinion.
<p>WOODER. Beg pardon, sir?
<p>THE GOVERNOR. Christmas!
<p>He turns towards the window, leaving WOODER looking at him with a sort of pained anxiety.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. Not at all, Mr. Wooder.
<p>WOODER. Very good, sir.
<p>The DOCTOR has come out of FALDER's Cell, and the GOVERNOR beckons to him.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. Well?
<p>THE DOCTOR. I can't make anything much of him. He's nervous, of course.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. Is there any sort of case to report? Quite frankly, Doctor.
<p>THE DOCTOR. Well, I don't think the separates doing him any good; but then I could say the same of a lot of them - they'd get on better in the shops, there's no doubt.
<p>THE GOVERNOR. You mean you'd have to recommend others?
<p>THE GOVERNOR. It doesn't amount to melancholia?
<p>As he says thin he looks absently at WOODER.
<p>WOODER. Beg pardon, sir?
<p>For answer the GOVERNOR stares at him, turns on his heel, and walks away. There is a sound as of beating on metal.
<p>WOODER. Banging on his door, sir. I thought we should have more of that.
<p>He hurries forward, passing the GOVERNOR, who follows closely.
<p>The curtain falls.
<p>The curtain falls.
<p>The scene is again COKESON'S room, at a few minutes to ten of a March morning, two years later. The doors are all open. SWEEDLE, now blessed with a sprouting moustache, is getting the offices ready. He arranges papers on COKESON'S table; then goes to a covered washstand, raises the lid, and looks at himself in the mirror. While he is gazing his full RUTH HONEYWILL comes in through the outer office and stands in the doorway. There seems a kind of exultation and excitement behind her habitual impassivity.
<p>RUTH. Yes.
<p>RUTH. He did.
<p>But COKESON has come in through the outer office; brisk with east wind, and decidedly greyer.
<p>RUTH. Yes. I'm not living where I was.
<p>RUTH. I couldn't stay with Honeywill, after all.
<p>COKESON. You haven't done anything rash, I hope. I should be sorry if you'd done anything rash.
<p>RUTH. I've kept the children with me.
<p>RUTH. Yes, I ran across him yesterday.
<p>COKESON. I hope he's well.
<p>RUTH. He was only there three weeks. It got out.
<p>COKESON. I'm sure I don't know what I can do for you. I don't like to be snubby.
<p>RUTH. I can't bear his being like that.
<p>RUTH. Not now. I could have - but not now.
<p>COKESON. I don't understand.
<p>RUTH. I'd have gone home to my people in the country long ago, but they've never got over me marrying Honeywill. I never was waywise, Mr. Cokeson, but I'm proud. I was only a girl, you see, when I married him. I thought the world of him, of course... he used to come travelling to our farm.
<p>RUTH. He used me worse than ever. He couldn't break my nerve, but I lost my health; and then he began knocking the children about. I couldn't stand that. I wouldn't go back now, if he were dying.
<p>COKESON. My dear woman! We mustn't talk like that.
<p>COKESON. Dear! Oh dear! I never came across a thing like this.
<p>RUTH. If he could only get here - where there's nothing to find out about him!
<p>COKESON. We can't have anything derogative to the firm.
<p>RUTH. I've no one else to go to.
<p>COKESON. I'll speak to the partners, but I don't think they'll take him, under the circumstances. I don't really.
<p>RUTH. It would be the saving of him.
<p>RUTH. Thank you.
<p>She moves towards the door, turns as if to speak, but does not, and goes away.
<p>COKESON. Was that young Richards coming here to-day after the clerk's place?
<p>SWEEDLE. Yes.
<p>COKESON. Well, keep him in the air; I don't want to see him yet.
<p>SWEEDLE. What shall I tell him, sir?
<p>SWEEDLE. Shall I tell him that we've got illness, sir?
<p>COKESON. No! Nothing untrue. Say I'm not here to-day.
<p>SWEEDLE. Yes, sir. Keep him hankering?
<p>COKESON. Exactly. And look here. You remember Falder? I may be having him round to see me. Now, treat him like you'd have him treat you in a similar position.
<p>SWEEDLE. I naturally should do.
<p>COKESON. That's right. When a man's down never hit 'im. 'Tisn't necessary. Give him a hand up. That's a metaphor I recommend to you in life. It's sound policy.
<p>SWEEDLE. Do you think the governors will take him on again, sir?
<p>He breaks off as FALDER comes in. FALDER is thin, pale, older, his eyes have grown more restless. His clothes are very worn and loose. SWEEDLE, nodding cheerfully, withdraws.
<p>FALDER timidly takes COKESON's hand and glances towards the partners' door.
<p>FALDER. I'm alive, Mr. Cokeson.
<p>FALDER. Oh! they passed me sound enough.
<p>COKESON. But they got you a place, didn't they?
<p>FALSER. Yes; very good people, knew all about it - very kind to me. I thought I was going to get on first rate. But one day, all of a sudden, the other clerks got wind of it.... I couldn't stick it, Mr. COKESON, I couldn't, sir.
<p>COKESON. Easy, my dear fellow, easy!
<p>FALDER. I had one small job after that, but it didn't last.
<p>COKESON. How was that?
<p>FALDER. It's no good deceiving you, Mr. Cokeson. The fact is, I seem to be struggling against a thing that's all round me. I can't explain it: it's as if I was in a net; as fast as I cut it here, it grows up there. I didn't act as I ought to have, about references; but what are you to do? You must have them. And that made me afraid, and I left. In fact, I'm - I'm afraid all the time now.
<p>He bows his head and leans dejectedly silent over the table.
<p>COKESON. I feel for you - I do really. Aren't your sisters going to do anything for you?
<p>FALDER. One's in consumption. And the other - -
<p>COKESON. Ye...es. She told me her husband wasn't quite pleased with you.
<p>FALDER. When I went there - they were at supper - my sister wanted to give me a kiss - I know. But he just looked at her, and said: "What have you come for?" Well, I pocketed my pride and I said: "Aren't you going to give me your hand, Jim? Cis is, I know," I said. "Look here!" he said, "that's all very well, but we'd better come to an understanding. I've been expecting you, and I've made up my mind. I'll give you fifteen pounds to go to Canada with." "I see," I said - "good riddance! No, thanks; keep your fifteen pounds." Friendship's a queer thing when you've been where I have.
<p>FALDER. I'm not allowed to leave the country.
<p>COKESON. Oh! ye...es - ticket-of-leave? You aren't looking the thing.
<p>FALDER. I've slept in the Park three nights this week. The dawns aren't all poetry there. But meeting her - I feel a different man this morning. I've often thought the being fond of hers the best thing about me; it's sacred, somehow - and yet it did for me. That's queer, isn't it?
<p>COKESON. I'm sure we're all very sorry for you.
<p>COKESON. Come, come, it's no use calling yourself names. That never did a man any good. Put a face on it.
<p>FALDER. It's easy enough to put a face on it, sir, when you're independent. Try it when you're down like me. They talk about giving you your deserts. Well, I think I've had just a bit over.
<p>FALDER is suddenly still, as if brooding over his past self; he utters a peculiar laugh.
<p>COKESON. You must give them credit for the best intentions. Really you must. Nobody wishes you harm, I'm sure.
<p>FALDER, goes uncertainly out into the clerks' office.
<p>JAMES. Is that so, COKESON?
<p>COKESON. I wanted to ask you. He's had his lesson. Now we know all about him, and we want a clerk. There is a young fellow applying, but I'm keeping him in the air.
<p>JAMES. A gaol-bird in the office, COKESON? I don't see it.
<p>WALTER. "The rolling of the chariot-wheels of Justice!" I've never got that out of my head.
<p>JAMES. I've nothing to reproach myself with in this affair. What's he been doing since he came out?
<p>COKESON. He's had one or two places, but he hasn't kept them. He's sensitive - quite natural. Seems to fancy everybody's down on him.
<p>JAMES. Bad sign. Don't like the fellow - never did from the first. "Weak character"'s written all over him.
<p>WALTER. I think we owe him a leg up.
<p>JAMES. He brought it all on himself.
<p>WALTER. The doctrine of full responsibility doesn't quite hold in these days.
<p>WALTER. For oneself, yes - not for other people, thanks.
<p>JAMES. Well! I don't want to be hard.
<p>JAMES. What about that woman he was mixed up with? I saw some one uncommonly like her outside as we came in.
<p>COKESON. That! Well, I can't keep anything from you. He has met her.
<p>JAMES. Is she with her husband?
<p>COKESON. No.
<p>JAMES. Falder living with her, I suppose?
<p>JAMES. It's our business, if we're going to engage him, COKESON.
<p>COKESON. The two things together make it very awkward for you - I see that.
<p>JAMES. No, no! He must make a clean sheet of it, or he can't come here.
<p>WALTER. Poor devil!
<p>FALDER comes in. He has pulled himself together, and presents a steady front.
<p>JAMES. Now look here, Falder. My son and I want to give you another chance; but there are two things I must say to you. In the first place: It's no good coming here as a victim. If you've any notion that you've been unjustly treated - get rid of it. You can't play fast and loose with morality and hope to go scot-free. If Society didn't take care of itself, nobody would - the sooner you realise that the better.
<p>FALDER. Yes, sir; but - may I say something?
<p>JAMES. Well?
<p>FALDER. There were all sorts there. And what I mean, sir, is, that if we'd been treated differently the first time, and put under somebody that could look after us a bit, and not put in prison, not a quarter of us would ever have got there.
<p>JAMES. My good fellow, don't forget that you began it.
<p>FALDER. I never wanted to do wrong.
<p>JAMES. Perhaps not. But you did.
<p>JAMES. This isn't encouraging for us, Falder.
<p>COKESON. He's putting it awkwardly, Mr. James.
<p>JAMES. Now, lay aside all those thoughts, Falder, and look to the future.
<p>He grips his chest.
<p>WALTER. Yes, but, my dear fellow, that'll pass away. Time's merciful.
<p>During this and what follows COKESON becomes more and more uneasy.
<p>JAMES. This is painful, Falder. But you must see for yourself that it's impossible for a firm like this to close its eyes to everything. Give us this proof of your resolve to keep straight, and you can come back - not otherwise.
<p>I'm all she's got to look to. And I'm sure she's all I've got.
<p>JAMES. I'm very sorry, Falder, but I must be firm. It's for the benefit of you both in the long run. No good can come of this connection. It was the cause of all your disaster.
<p>FALDER. But sir, it means-having gone through all that-getting broken up - my nerves are in an awful state - for nothing. I did it for her.
<p>JAMES. Come! If she's anything of a woman she'll see it for herself. She won't want to drag you down further. If there were a prospect of your being able to marry her - it might be another thing.
<p>WALTER. I'm inclined to do what you say, Falder, if it can be managed.
<p>FALDER. Oh, sir!
<p>He goes to the window and looks down into the street.
<p>WALTER hesitates, and looks from COKESON to JAMES.
<p>FALDER beckons from the window.
<p>FALDER has come from the window. The three men look at him in a sort of awed silence.
<p>SWEEDLE comes in from the outer office.
<p>COKESON. What is it?
<p>JAMES. Show her in.
<p>RUTH comes slowly in, and stands stoically with FALDER on one side and the three men on the other. No one speaks. COKESON turns to his table, bending over his papers as though the burden of the situation were forcing him back into his accustomed groove.
<p>RUTH. Yes - only yesterday.
<p>RUTH, who is looking at FALDER, begins to twist her hands in front of her as though prescient of disaster.
<p>FALDER. Mr. Walter How is good enough to say that he'll help us to get you a divorce.
<p>RUTH flashes a startled glance at JAMES and WALTER.
<p>JAMES. I don't think that's practicable, Falder.
<p>FALDER. But, Sir - - !
<p>RUTH. Yes, Sir; I love him.
<p>She looks miserably at FALDER.
<p>JAMES. Then you don't want to stand in his way, do you?
<p>JAMES. The best way you can take care of him will be to give him up.
<p>FALDER. Nothing shall make me give you up. You can get a divorce. There's been nothing between us, has there?
<p>FALDER. We'll keep apart till it's over, sir; if you'll only help us - we promise.
<p>JAMES. The situation is impossible.
<p>RUTH. Must I, Sir?
<p>JAMES. I believe you, Falder. Come, my lad, be as plucky as she is.
<p>WALTER. Father!
<p>RUTH looks at him; and FALDER covers his face with his hands. There is silence.
<p>He points to the clerks' room and moves towards the outer office. FALDER does not move. RUTH puts out her hand timidly. He shrinks back from the touch. She turns and goes miserably into the clerks' room. With a brusque movement he follows, seizing her by the shoulder just inside the doorway. COKESON shuts the door.
<p>The detective enters, and closes the door behind him.
<p>WISTER. Sorry to disturb you, sir. A clerk you had here, two years and a half ago: I arrested him in, this room.
<p>JAMES. What about him?
<p>JAMES. What do you want with him?
<p>WISTER. He's failed to report himself this last four weeks.
<p>WALTER. How d'you mean?
<p>WISTER. Ticket-of-leave won't be up for another six months, sir.
<p>WALTER. Has he to keep in touch with the police till then?
<p>WISTER. We're bound to know where he sleeps every night. I dare say we shouldn't interfere, sir, even though he hasn't reported himself. But we've just heard there's a serious matter of obtaining employment with a forged reference. What with the two things together - we must have him.
<p>Again there is silence. WALTER and COKESON steal glances at JAMES, who stands staring steadily at the detective.
<p>As he speaks his eye falls on FALDER'S cap, still lying on the table, and his face contracts.
<p>JAMES. I shelter no one. But you mustn't come here and ask questions which it's not my business to answer.
<p>COKESON. I'm sorry we couldn't give you the information. You quite understand, don't you? Good-morning!
<p>WISTER turns to go, but instead of going to the door of the outer office he goes to the door of the clerks' room.
<p>COKESON. The other door.... the other door!
<p>WISTER opens the clerks' door. RUTHS's voice is heard: "Oh, do!" and FALDER'S: "I can't!" There is a little pause; then, with sharp fright, RUTH says: "Who's that?" WISTER has gone in. The three men look aghast at the door.
<p>He comes swiftly out with his arm twisted in FALDER'S. The latter gives a white, staring look at the three men.
<p>WALTER. Let him go this time, for God's sake!
<p>WISTER. I couldn't take the responsibility, sir.
<p>Flinging a look back at RUTH, he throws up his head, and goes out through the outer office, half dragging WISTER after him.
<p>SWEEDLE can be seen staring through the outer door. There are sounds of footsteps descending the stone stairs; suddenly a dull thud, a faint "My God!" in WISTER's voice.
<p>JAMES. What's that?
<p>SWEEDLE dashes forward. The door swings to behind him. There is dead silence.
<p>He and COKESON support the fainting RUTH from the doorway of the clerks' room.
<p>WALTER. Have you any brandy?
<p>COKESON. I've got sherry.
<p>WALTER. Get it, then. Quick!
<p>He places RUTH in a chair - which JAMES has dragged forward.
<p>There is the sound of feet, and they stop to listen. The outer door is reopened - WISTER and SWEEDLE are seen carrying some burden.
<p>They lay the burden doom in the outer office, out of sight, and all but RUTH cluster round it, speaking in hushed voices.
<p>WISTER. He jumped - neck's broken.
<p>WALTER. Good God!
<p>WISTER. He must have been mad to think he could give me the slip like that. And what was it - just a few months!
<p>WISTER goes out. On RUTH's face an expression of fear and horror has been seen growing, as if she dared not turn towards the voices. She now rises and steals towards them.
<p>The three men shrink back out of her way, one by one, into COKESON'S room. RUTH drops on her knees by the body.
<p>In the outer office doorway the figures of men am seen standing.
<p>At the sound behind her RUTH faces round at him.
<p>COKESON. No one'll touch him now! Never again! He's safe with gentle Jesus!
<p>RUTH stands as though turned to stone in the doorway staring at COKESON, who, bending humbly before her, holds out his hand as one would to a lost dog.
<p>The curtain falls.
